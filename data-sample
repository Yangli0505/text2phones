So I did. :: S OW _ AY _ D IH D .
Or is it? :: AO R _ IH Z _ IH T ?
Why do it? :: W AY _ D UW _ IH T ?
Or is he? :: AO R _ IH Z _ HH IY ?
So I left. :: S OW _ AY _ L EH F T .
Who is he? :: HH UW _ IH Z _ HH IY ?
Or do they? :: AO R _ D UW _ DH EY ?
Or was it? :: AO R _ W AA Z _ IH T ?
Or did it? :: AO R _ D IH D _ IH T ?
Off I went. :: AO F _ AY _ W EH N T .
I will win. :: AY _ W IH L _ W IH N .
I was dead. :: AY _ W AA Z _ D EH D .
But is he? :: B AH T _ IH Z _ HH IY ?
Is that it? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ IH T ?
You will be. :: Y UW _ W IH L _ B IY .
It might be. :: IH T _ M AY T _ B IY .
Face to face :: F EY S _ T UW _ F EY S
Could it be? :: K UH D _ IH T _ B IY ?
She's a spy! :: SH IY Z _ AH _ S P AY !
She is free. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ F R IY .
It's a joke. :: IH T S _ AH _ JH OW K .
Who can say? :: HH UW _ K AE N _ S EY ?
I was lost. :: AY _ W AA Z _ L AO S T .
That may be. :: DH AE T _ M EY _ B IY .
In it went. :: IH N _ IH T _ W EH N T .
Why is this? :: W AY _ IH Z _ DH IH S ?
Why is that? :: W AY _ IH Z _ DH AE T ?
Are we here? :: AA R _ W IY _ HH IY R ?
It's a shame. :: IH T S _ AH _ SH EY M .
It was good. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ G UH D .
It's a fact. :: IH T S _ AH _ F AE K T .
It was nice. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N AY S .
Did it work? :: D IH D _ IH T _ W ER K ?
But what is? :: B AH T _ W AH T _ IH Z ?
And does it? :: AH N D _ D AH Z _ IH T ?
Who was she? :: HH UW _ W AA Z _ SH IY ?
They are real. :: DH EY _ AA R _ R IY L .
Had I heard? :: HH AE D _ AY _ HH ER D ?
But she was. :: B AH T _ SH IY _ W AA Z .
Life is good. :: L AY F _ IH Z _ G UH D .
It is huge. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH Y UW JH .
He's a star. :: HH IY Z _ AH _ S T AA R .
As we worked. :: AE Z _ W IY _ W ER K T .
You should be. :: Y UW _ SH UH D _ B IY .
It will work. :: IH T _ W IH L _ W ER K .
They are good. :: DH EY _ AA R _ G UH D .
We were used. :: W IY _ W ER _ Y UW Z D .
Sex is fun? :: S EH K S _ IH Z _ F AH N ?
Well, was it? :: W EH L , W AA Z _ IH T ?
Or have they? :: AO R _ HH AE V _ DH EY ?
Are they free? :: AA R _ DH EY _ F R IY ?
We will push. :: W IY _ W IH L _ P UH SH .
I was awful. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AA F AH L .
It could work. :: IH T _ K UH D _ W ER K .
Where are they? :: W EH R _ AA R _ DH EY ?
I'm not sure. :: AY M _ N AA T _ SH UH R .
What were they? :: W AH T _ W ER _ DH EY ?
Who can tell? :: HH UW _ K AE N _ T EH L ?
What is that? :: W AH T _ IH Z _ DH AE T ?
It was clear. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K L IH R .
I was shocked. :: AY _ W AA Z _ SH AA K T .
Here's a clue. :: HH IH R Z _ AH _ K L UW .
They are wrong. :: DH EY _ AA R _ R AO NG .
I was scared. :: AY _ W AA Z _ S K EH R D .
Is that right? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ R AY T ?
We are ready. :: W IY _ AA R _ R EH D IY .
went on sale. :: W EH N T _ AA N _ S EY L .
Note the date. :: N OW T _ DH AH _ D EY T .
Did he trip? :: D IH D _ HH IY _ T R IH P ?
It's the Tate. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ T EY T .
It can help. :: IH T _ K AE N _ HH EH L P .
And it showed. :: AH N D _ IH T _ SH OW D .
But who knows? :: B AH T _ HH UW _ N OW Z ?
Who was that? :: HH UW _ W AA Z _ DH AE T ?
Feel the heat? :: F IY L _ DH AH _ HH IY T ?
It's not fair. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ F EH R .
We're in shock. :: W IY R _ IH N _ SH AA K .
I am a star. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ S T AA R .
But it failed. :: B AH T _ IH T _ F EY L D .
We were awful. :: W IY _ W ER _ AA F AH L .
It was ugly. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH G L IY .
It's not true. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ T R UW .
This one did. :: DH IH S _ W AH N _ D IH D .
I was stunned. :: AY _ W AA Z _ S T AH N D .
We are happy. :: W IY _ AA R _ HH AE P IY .
Peace was won. :: P IY S _ W AA Z _ W AH N .
It's a winner. :: IH T S _ AH _ W IH N ER .
What's it for? :: W AH T S _ IH T _ F AO R ?
Which is worse? :: W IH CH _ IH Z _ W ER S ?
Why change it? :: W AY _ CH EY N JH _ IH T ?
It has failed. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ F EY L D .
It is unique. :: IH T _ IH Z _ Y UW N IY K .
Neither it is. :: N IY DH ER _ IH T _ IH Z .
I've been there. :: AY V _ B IH N _ DH EH R .
Yet, it worked. :: Y EH T , IH T _ W ER K T .
There's a pause. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ P AO Z .
I was angry. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AE NG G R IY .
It is minute. :: IH T _ IH Z _ M IH N AH T .
Feel the heat? :: F IY L _ DH AH _ HH IY T ?
Jobs could go. :: JH AA B Z _ K UH D _ G OW .
Who would have? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ HH AE V ?
It is a blow. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ B L OW .
Well, it won't. :: W EH L , IH T _ W OW N T .
It's good news. :: IH T S _ G UH D _ N UW Z .
And he laughs. :: AH N D _ HH IY _ L AE F S .
I do my job. :: AY _ D UW _ M AY _ JH AA B .
All of us do. :: AO L _ AH V _ AH S _ D UW .
What is next? :: W AH T _ IH Z _ N EH K S T ?
But who cares? :: B AH T _ HH UW _ K EH R Z ?
And that's it? :: AH N D _ DH AE T S _ IH T ?
What was this? :: W AH T _ W AA Z _ DH IH S ?
He is a pro. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ P R OW .
I had a son. :: AY _ HH AE D _ AH _ S AH N .
It is urgent. :: IH T _ IH Z _ ER JH AH N T .
He is severe. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ S AH V IH R .
The judge said. :: DH AH _ JH AH JH _ S EH D .
It's very odd. :: IH T S _ V EH R IY _ AA D .
I'm so angry. :: AY M _ S OW _ AE NG G R IY .
It is bizarre. :: IH T _ IH Z _ B AH Z AA R .
Does this mean. :: D AH Z _ DH IH S _ M IY N .
It's so awful. :: IH T S _ S OW _ AA F AH L .
They are ready. :: DH EY _ AA R _ R EH D IY .
Does it, Noel? :: D AH Z _ IH T , N OW EH L ?
I hope we do. :: AY _ HH OW P _ W IY _ D UW .
It was a joy. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ JH OY .
I had to lie. :: AY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ L AY .
It is normal. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AO R M AH L .
It is so sad. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S OW _ S AE D .
I was rubbish. :: AY _ W AA Z _ R AH B IH SH .
It is rubbish. :: IH T _ IH Z _ R AH B IH SH .
It's an idea. :: IH T S _ AE N _ AY D IY AH .
A neighbour said. :: AH _ N EY B ER _ S EH D .
She is superb. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ S UH P ER B .
Does it matter? :: D AH Z _ IH T _ M AE T ER ?
I would say so. :: AY _ W UH D _ S EY _ S OW .
I know my job. :: AY _ N OW _ M AY _ JH AA B .
This is a lie. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ L AY .
So now we know. :: S OW _ N AW _ W IY _ N OW .
We can do it. :: W IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ IH T .
It was a hit. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH IH T .
It's quite nice. :: IH T S _ K W AY T _ N AY S .
He was solid. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ S AA L AH D .
He is driven. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ D R IH V AH N .
It is a farce. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ F AA R S .
It's been hard. :: IH T S _ B IH N _ HH AA R D .
It was magic. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ M AE JH IH K .
What do we do? :: W AH T _ D UW _ W IY _ D UW ?
She's been shot. :: SH IY Z _ B IH N _ SH AA T .
So I moved on. :: S OW _ AY _ M UW V D _ AA N .
We lost a boy. :: W IY _ L AO S T _ AH _ B OY .
What's the rush? :: W AH T S _ DH AH _ R AH SH ?
I told you so. :: AY _ T OW L D _ Y UW _ S OW .
It's my nature. :: IH T S _ M AY _ N EY CH ER .
Was it a foul? :: W AA Z _ IH T _ AH _ F AW L ?
So it goes on. :: S OW _ IH T _ G OW Z _ AA N .
So now you know. :: S OW _ N AW _ Y UW _ N OW .
I am a player. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ P L EY ER .
Can he do it? :: K AE N _ HH IY _ D UW _ IH T ?
It is a worry. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ W ER IY .
O no it's not! :: OW _ N OW _ IH T S _ N AA T !
I am the head. :: AY _ AE M _ DH AH _ HH EH D .
We are at war. :: W IY _ AA R _ AE T _ W AO R .
What do we do? :: W AH T _ D UW _ W IY _ D UW ?
Art is extra. :: AA R T _ IH Z _ EH K S T R AH .
It was mayhem. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ M EY HH EH M .
It's not ideal. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AY D IY L .
It's only fair. :: IH T S _ OW N L IY _ F EH R .
I have a cold. :: AY _ HH AE V _ AH _ K OW L D .
But I managed. :: B AH T _ AY _ M AE N AH JH D .
It's very safe. :: IH T S _ V EH R IY _ S EY F .
It's very nice. :: IH T S _ V EH R IY _ N AY S .
Then , he laughs. :: DH EH N , HH IY _ L AE F S .
It's very good. :: IH T S _ V EH R IY _ G UH D .
Such as it is. :: S AH CH _ AE Z _ IH T _ IH Z .
What went wrong? :: W AH T _ W EH N T _ R AO NG ?
I get the bus. :: AY _ G EH T _ DH AH _ B AH S .
What's the theme? :: W AH T S _ DH AH _ TH IY M ?
You are a liar. :: Y UW _ AA R _ AH _ L AY ER .
It's up to Ann. :: IH T S _ AH P _ T UW _ AE N .
I should say so. :: AY _ SH UH D _ S EY _ S OW .
I said to him. :: AY _ S EH D _ T UW _ HH IH M .
I know my sons. :: AY _ N OW _ M AY _ S AH N Z .
I am not sure. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ SH UH R .
Is it all real? :: IH Z _ IH T _ AO L _ R IY L ?
But who is it? :: B AH T _ HH UW _ IH Z _ IH T ?
What do you do. :: W AH T _ D UW _ Y UW _ D UW .
What do you do? :: W AH T _ D UW _ Y UW _ D UW ?
I took the gun. :: AY _ T UH K _ DH AH _ G AH N .
There's the mix. :: DH EH R Z _ DH AH _ M IH K S .
We do the same. :: W IY _ D UW _ DH AH _ S EY M .
It is annoying. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH N OY IH NG .
He's a genius. :: HH IY Z _ AH _ JH IY N Y AH S .
I will tell you. :: AY _ W IH L _ T EH L _ Y UW .
I would love it. :: AY _ W UH D _ L AH V _ IH T .
He knows a lot. :: HH IY _ N OW Z _ AH _ L AA T .
He may need it. :: HH IY _ M EY _ N IY D _ IH T .
That would help. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ HH EH L P .
Who will do it? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ D UW _ IH T ?
I HAVE a dream. :: AY _ HH AE V _ AH _ D R IY M .
They got upset. :: DH EY _ G AA T _ AH P S EH T .
How are you, sir? :: HH AW _ AA R _ Y UW , S ER ?
Is it worth it? :: IH Z _ IH T _ W ER TH _ IH T ?
I am an actor. :: AY _ AE M _ AE N _ AE K T ER .
I want my mum. :: AY _ W AA N T _ M AY _ M AH M .
So it was sad. :: S OW _ IH T _ W AA Z _ S AE D .
Maybe, who knows? :: M EY B IY , HH UW _ N OW Z ?
I am so sorry. :: AY _ AE M _ S OW _ S AA R IY .
I have a choice. :: AY _ HH AE V _ AH _ CH OY S .
What's the point? :: W AH T S _ DH AH _ P OY N T ?
I wish it well. :: AY _ W IH SH _ IH T _ W EH L .
As if he would. :: AE Z _ IH F _ HH IY _ W UH D .
It was so sad. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S OW _ S AE D .
What's it about? :: W AH T S _ IH T _ AH B AW T ?
I love it here. :: AY _ L AH V _ IH T _ HH IY R .
I am a doctor. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ D AA K T ER .
How are you, sir? :: HH AW _ AA R _ Y UW , S ER ?
It's a blessing. :: IH T S _ AH _ B L EH S IH NG .
It is not fair. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ F EH R .
Is it worth it? :: IH Z _ IH T _ W ER TH _ IH T ?
Indeed, he does. :: IH N D IY D , HH IY _ D AH Z .
Try to save us. :: T R AY _ T UW _ S EY V _ AH S .
I love the Dome. :: AY _ L AH V _ DH AH _ D OW M .
I'm very lucky. :: AY M _ V EH R IY _ L AH K IY .
Who will do it? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ D UW _ IH T ?
He's a nice guy. :: HH IY Z _ AH _ N AY S _ G AY .
It is out there. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AW T _ DH EH R .
Who will attend? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ AH T EH N D ?
He was possessed :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ P AH Z EH S T
I was too young. :: AY _ W AA Z _ T UW _ Y AH NG .
I knew him well. :: AY _ N UW _ HH IH M _ W EH L .
It was ignored. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ IH G N AO R D .
It is my fault. :: IH T _ IH Z _ M AY _ F AO L T .
He is a bully. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ B UH L IY .
But they add up. :: B AH T _ DH EY _ AE D _ AH P .
You write a play. :: Y UW _ R AY T _ AH _ P L EY .
Are we not men? :: AA R _ W IY _ N AA T _ M EH N ?
So it should be. :: S OW _ IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY .
I've done it all. :: AY V _ D AH N _ IH T _ AO L .
Then you see it. :: DH EH N _ Y UW _ S IY _ IH T .
Our time is up. :: AW ER _ T AY M _ IH Z _ AH P .
As it should be. :: AE Z _ IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY .
It is their day. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH EH R _ D EY .
So who is right? :: S OW _ HH UW _ IH Z _ R AY T ?
So there we are. :: S OW _ DH EH R _ W IY _ AA R .
I can't get it. :: AY _ K AE N T _ G EH T _ IH T .
How do you feel? :: HH AW _ D UW _ Y UW _ F IY L ?
We are in shock. :: W IY _ AA R _ IH N _ SH AA K .
I've had a ball. :: AY V _ HH AE D _ AH _ B AO L .
Help is needed. :: HH EH L P _ IH Z _ N IY D AH D .
I was furious. :: AY _ W AA Z _ F Y UH R IY AH S .
I am so upset. :: AY _ AE M _ S OW _ AH P S EH T .
That's the truth. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ T R UW TH .
Who will attend? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ AH T EH N D ?
You take a risk. :: Y UW _ T EY K _ AH _ R IH S K .
We are so proud. :: W IY _ AA R _ S OW _ P R AW D .
That is no use. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N OW _ Y UW S .
Nothing is safe. :: N AH TH IH NG _ IH Z _ S EY F .
I watched a game. :: AY _ W AA CH T _ AH _ G EY M .
It's a dead end. :: IH T S _ AH _ D EH D _ EH N D .
I was the sheep. :: AY _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ SH IY P .
Sure, it's funny. :: SH UH R , IH T S _ F AH N IY .
Sadly, it can't. :: S AE D L IY , IH T _ K AE N T .
Does this matter? :: D AH Z _ DH IH S _ M AE T ER ?
I'm glad I came. :: AY M _ G L AE D _ AY _ K EY M .
I lost my head. :: AY _ L AO S T _ M AY _ HH EH D .
I hate the word. :: AY _ HH EY T _ DH AH _ W ER D .
I hit you there. :: AY _ HH IH T _ Y UW _ DH EH R .
He's got to go. :: HH IY Z _ G AA T _ T UW _ G OW .
Let us hope so. :: L EH T _ AH S _ HH OW P _ S OW .
And she got it. :: AH N D _ SH IY _ G AA T _ IH T .
So he should be. :: S OW _ HH IY _ SH UH D _ B IY .
And it paid off. :: AH N D _ IH T _ P EY D _ AO F .
I won't go back. :: AY _ W OW N T _ G OW _ B AE K .
I said How much? :: AY _ S EH D _ HH AW _ M AH CH ?
It will be fine. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ F AY N .
We can do both. :: W IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ B OW TH .
I just made it. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ M EY D _ IH T .
I'd like to run. :: AY D _ L AY K _ T UW _ R AH N .
Are you all right? :: AA R _ Y UW _ AO L _ R AY T ?
What will it be? :: W AH T _ W IH L _ IH T _ B IY ?
How did he know? :: HH AW _ D IH D _ HH IY _ N OW ?
Now they had it. :: N AW _ DH EY _ HH AE D _ IH T .
He needs to be. :: HH IY _ N IY D Z _ T UW _ B IY .
What can you do? :: W AH T _ K AE N _ Y UW _ D UW ?
It has to work. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ W ER K .
It's in the eyes. :: IH T S _ IH N _ DH AH _ AY Z .
Is he conscious? :: IH Z _ HH IY _ K AA N SH AH S ?
It's not a game. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ G EY M .
Or so it seemed. :: AO R _ S OW _ IH T _ S IY M D .
That is the key. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K IY .
He did it well. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ IH T _ W EH L .
Of course it is. :: AH V _ K AO R S _ IH T _ IH Z .
Well, we know now. :: W EH L , W IY _ N OW _ N AW .
It was too soon. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ S UW N .
I had no choice. :: AY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ CH OY S .
Or so we thought. :: AO R _ S OW _ W IY _ TH AO T .
We need to chat. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ CH AE T .
It's just awful. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ AA F AH L .
Is that success? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ S AH K S EH S ?
It's so special. :: IH T S _ S OW _ S P EH SH AH L .
It was chaotic. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K EY AA T IH K .
It is long gone. :: IH T _ IH Z _ L AO NG _ G AO N .
We're on our way. :: W IY R _ AA N _ AW ER _ W EY .
I will miss him. :: AY _ W IH L _ M IH S _ HH IH M .
He has retired. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ R IH T AY R D .
You know the type. :: Y UW _ N OW _ DH AH _ T AY P .
That could change. :: DH AE T _ K UH D _ CH EY N JH .
It will be tight. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ T AY T .
But I was wrong. :: B AH T _ AY _ W AA Z _ R AO NG .
Was it worth it? :: W AA Z _ IH T _ W ER TH _ IH T ?
I saw one body. :: AY _ S AO _ W AH N _ B AA D IY .
Or so he thought. :: AO R _ S OW _ HH IY _ TH AO T .
We were caught out. :: W IY _ W ER _ K AA T _ AW T .
It was on fire. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AA N _ F AY ER .
Get to know him. :: G EH T _ T UW _ N OW _ HH IH M .
It's a miracle. :: IH T S _ AH _ M IH R AH K AH L .
There's a danger. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ D EY N JH ER .
It all came good. :: IH T _ AO L _ K EY M _ G UH D .
He should resign. :: HH IY _ SH UH D _ R IH Z AY N .
You have a plan? :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ AH _ P L AE N ?
They must do it. :: DH EY _ M AH S T _ D UW _ IH T .
It was hopeless. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ HH OW P L AH S .
You are in power. :: Y UW _ AA R _ IH N _ P AW ER .
Of course he is. :: AH V _ K AO R S _ HH IY _ IH Z .
I'm not a diva. :: AY M _ N AA T _ AH _ D IY V AH .
That is my role. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ M AY _ R OW L .
He is a Satan. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ S EY T AH N .
Pray that is so. :: P R EY _ DH AE T _ IH Z _ S OW .
Which he is, too. :: W IH CH _ HH IY _ IH Z , T UW .
That got me out. :: DH AE T _ G AA T _ M IY _ AW T .
Which is a shame. :: W IH CH _ IH Z _ AH _ SH EY M .
Get used to it. :: G EH T _ Y UW Z D _ T UW _ IH T .
But it was fun. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ F AH N .
Is it any good? :: IH Z _ IH T _ EH N IY _ G UH D ?
Should he resign? :: SH UH D _ HH IY _ R IH Z AY N ?
It would be nice. :: IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ N AY S .
Why does it work? :: W AY _ D AH Z _ IH T _ W ER K ?
What's in a name? :: W AH T S _ IH N _ AH _ N EY M ?
We had to laugh. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ L AE F .
The game was up. :: DH AH _ G EY M _ W AA Z _ AH P .
This is my life. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ M AY _ L AY F .
- Really you will! :: - R IH L IY _ Y UW _ W IH L !
What could we do? :: W AH T _ K UH D _ W IY _ D UW ?
It is a relief. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ R IH L IY F .
You will need it. :: Y UW _ W IH L _ N IY D _ IH T .
He has a point. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ AH _ P OY N T .
What can you say? :: W AH T _ K AE N _ Y UW _ S EY ?
He will be fine. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ B IY _ F AY N .
It has paid off. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ P EY D _ AO F .
It's up to them. :: IH T S _ AH P _ T UW _ DH EH M .
It works for us. :: IH T _ W ER K S _ F AO R _ AH S .
Someone who cares :: S AH M W AH N _ HH UW _ K EH R Z
I might come back. :: AY _ M AY T _ K AH M _ B AE K .
Who will perform? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ P ER F AO R M ?
Was it the wife? :: W AA Z _ IH T _ DH AH _ W AY F ?
But she might be. :: B AH T _ SH IY _ M AY T _ B IY .
He has to learn. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ L ER N .
So there, we won. :: S OW _ DH EH R , W IY _ W AH N .
I have a theory. :: AY _ HH AE V _ AH _ TH IH R IY .
I joined a group. :: AY _ JH OY N D _ AH _ G R UW P .
They took a risk. :: DH EY _ T UH K _ AH _ R IH S K .
He could make it. :: HH IY _ K UH D _ M EY K _ IH T .
It was good fun. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ G UH D _ F AH N .
He has the edge. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ DH AH _ EH JH .
What has changed? :: W AH T _ HH AE Z _ CH EY N JH D ?
It is hard won. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH AA R D _ W AH N .
What has altered? :: W AH T _ HH AE Z _ AO L T ER D ?
I would miss him. :: AY _ W UH D _ M IH S _ HH IH M .
It is home-grown. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH OW M G R OW N .
It is horrible. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH AO R AH B AH L .
They may be wrong. :: DH EY _ M EY _ B IY _ R AO NG .
So they should be. :: S OW _ DH EY _ SH UH D _ B IY .
We must move on. :: W IY _ M AH S T _ M UW V _ AA N .
I've had my time. :: AY V _ HH AE D _ M AY _ T AY M .
The mood is good. :: DH AH _ M UW D _ IH Z _ G UH D .
What is the wife? :: W AH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ W AY F ?
I took my chance. :: AY _ T UH K _ M AY _ CH AE N S .
I want a career. :: AY _ W AA N T _ AH _ K ER IH R .
And they replied. :: AH N D _ DH EY _ R IH P L AY D .
We've all done it! :: W IY V _ AO L _ D AH N _ IH T !
I love this job. :: AY _ L AH V _ DH IH S _ JH AA B .
I wish him well. :: AY _ W IH SH _ HH IH M _ W EH L .
Have you noticed? :: HH AE V _ Y UW _ N OW T AH S T ?
Did you see that? :: D IH D _ Y UW _ S IY _ DH AE T ?
We are now open. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AW _ OW P AH N .
Or so she thought. :: AO R _ S OW _ SH IY _ TH AO T .
You just know it. :: Y UW _ JH AH S T _ N OW _ IH T .
How can this be? :: HH AW _ K AE N _ DH IH S _ B IY ?
He leaves a beat. :: HH IY _ L IY V Z _ AH _ B IY T .
You look at that. :: Y UW _ L UH K _ AE T _ DH AE T .
I hope he stays. :: AY _ HH OW P _ HH IY _ S T EY Z .
I will carry on. :: AY _ W IH L _ K AE R IY _ AA N .
Which he can do. :: W IH CH _ HH IY _ K AE N _ D UW .
How could it not? :: HH AW _ K UH D _ IH T _ N AA T ?
He is that good. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ DH AE T _ G UH D .
I called it right. :: AY _ K AO L D _ IH T _ R AY T .
Is it the flight? :: IH Z _ IH T _ DH AH _ F L AY T ?
Let's get it on. :: L EH T S _ G EH T _ IH T _ AA N .
And we were right. :: AH N D _ W IY _ W ER _ R AY T .
You read it right. :: Y UW _ R EH D _ IH T _ R AY T .
You have to wait. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ W EY T .
And if they fail? :: AH N D _ IH F _ DH EY _ F EY L ?
Here we go then. :: HH IY R _ W IY _ G OW _ DH EH N .
Is he any good? :: IH Z _ HH IY _ EH N IY _ G UH D ?
And so it should. :: AH N D _ S OW _ IH T _ SH UH D .
It was a virus. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ V AY R AH S .
It is a gamble. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ G AE M B AH L .
Saturday is gone. :: S AE T ER D IY _ IH Z _ G AO N .
A win is a win. :: AH _ W IH N _ IH Z _ AH _ W IH N .
What has changed? :: W AH T _ HH AE Z _ CH EY N JH D ?
What has altered? :: W AH T _ HH AE Z _ AO L T ER D ?
It's not like us. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ L AY K _ AH S .
As she explains. :: AE Z _ SH IY _ IH K S P L EY N Z .
It was typical. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T IH P AH K AH L .
Who can predict? :: HH UW _ K AE N _ P R IH D IH K T ?
It is mainstream. :: IH T _ IH Z _ M EY N S T R IY M .
Not so, it seems. :: N AA T _ S OW , IH T _ S IY M Z .
It's not perfect. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ P ER F EH K T .
He is to appeal. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ T UW _ AH P IY L .
It won the match. :: IH T _ W AH N _ DH AH _ M AE CH .
So, easy does it. :: S OW , IY Z IY _ D AH Z _ IH T .
I enjoy my work. :: AY _ EH N JH OY _ M AY _ W ER K .
He could tell you. :: HH IY _ K UH D _ T EH L _ Y UW .
I had enough on. :: AY _ HH AE D _ IH N AH F _ AA N .
Hard it will be. :: HH AA R D _ IH T _ W IH L _ B IY .
But we were wrong. :: B AH T _ W IY _ W ER _ R AO NG .
How would it work? :: HH AW _ W UH D _ IH T _ W ER K ?
Is the war over? :: IH Z _ DH AH _ W AO R _ OW V ER ?
It is my nature. :: IH T _ IH Z _ M AY _ N EY CH ER .
What do you want. :: W AH T _ D UW _ Y UW _ W AA N T .
And so they have. :: AH N D _ S OW _ DH EY _ HH AE V .
I think he will. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ HH IY _ W IH L .
I didn't do it. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ D UW _ IH T .
I'm sure he does. :: AY M _ SH UH R _ HH IY _ D AH Z .
That is her job. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ HH ER _ JH AA B .
And he still is. :: AH N D _ HH IY _ S T IH L _ IH Z .
I had no idea. :: AY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ AY D IY AH .
She would love it. :: SH IY _ W UH D _ L AH V _ IH T .
We must do that. :: W IY _ M AH S T _ D UW _ DH AE T .
This is the goal. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ G OW L .
What are they for? :: W AH T _ AA R _ DH EY _ F AO R ?
Now, it's all right. :: N AW , IH T S _ AO L _ R AY T .
He was popular. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ P AA P Y AH L ER .
That should do it. :: DH AE T _ SH UH D _ D UW _ IH T .
It is so unfair. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S OW _ AH N F EH R .
I'm not depressed. :: AY M _ N AA T _ D IH P R EH S T .
Who can predict? :: HH UW _ K AE N _ P R IH D IH K T ?
I was on a roll. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AA N _ AH _ R OW L .
I began to pray. :: AY _ B IH G AE N _ T UW _ P R EY .
Is this accurate? :: IH Z _ DH IH S _ AE K Y ER AH T ?
Who would be right? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ B IY _ R AY T ?
He's not perfect. :: HH IY Z _ N AA T _ P ER F EH K T .
We are in a war. :: W IY _ AA R _ IH N _ AH _ W AO R .
Tony had arrived. :: T OW N IY _ HH AE D _ ER AY V D .
It will take time. :: IH T _ W IH L _ T EY K _ T AY M .
Things can change. :: TH IH NG Z _ K AE N _ CH EY N JH .
It gets too much. :: IH T _ G EH T S _ T UW _ M AH CH .
He did his job. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ HH IH Z _ JH AA B .
It is a freedom. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ F R IY D AH M .
It's been my life. :: IH T S _ B IH N _ M AY _ L AY F .
TODAY it begins. :: T AH D EY _ IH T _ B IH G IH N Z .
It was a deceit. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ D AH S IY T .
What did we learn? :: W AH T _ D IH D _ W IY _ L ER N ?
What are they like? :: W AH T _ AA R _ DH EY _ L AY K ?
I'm a bit annoyed. :: AY M _ AH _ B IH T _ AH N OY D .
It was no avail. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N OW _ AH V EY L .
We won't do that. :: W IY _ W OW N T _ D UW _ DH AE T .
So she told him. :: S OW _ SH IY _ T OW L D _ HH IH M .
Well, there you go. :: W EH L , DH EH R _ Y UW _ G OW .
You would be wrong. :: Y UW _ W UH D _ B IY _ R AO NG .
It is up to Ann. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH P _ T UW _ AE N .
Will they fall out? :: W IH L _ DH EY _ F AO L _ AW T ?
It's such a shock. :: IH T S _ S AH CH _ AH _ SH AA K .
It's not a solo. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ S OW L OW .
No, they have not. :: N OW , DH EY _ HH AE V _ N AA T .
How can they tell? :: HH AW _ K AE N _ DH EY _ T EH L ?
It gives us hope. :: IH T _ G IH V Z _ AH S _ HH OW P .
It works, as well. :: IH T _ W ER K S , AE Z _ W EH L .
It's hard to say. :: IH T S _ HH AA R D _ T UW _ S EY .
You know the score. :: Y UW _ N OW _ DH AH _ S K AO R .
I didn't see it. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ S IY _ IH T .
I was on my own. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AA N _ M AY _ OW N .
We can't go home. :: W IY _ K AE N T _ G OW _ HH OW M .
That is not true. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ T R UW .
And what happens? :: AH N D _ W AH T _ HH AE P AH N Z ?
I have no idea. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N OW _ AY D IY AH .
I was saying, No. :: AY _ W AA Z _ S EY IH NG , N OW .
And he did that. :: AH N D _ HH IY _ D IH D _ DH AE T .
That is my dream. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ M AY _ D R IY M .
He got the part. :: HH IY _ G AA T _ DH AH _ P AA R T .
He liked to talk. :: HH IY _ L AY K T _ T UW _ T AO K .
One is too many. :: W AH N _ IH Z _ T UW _ M EH N IY .
Please call Stella. :: P L IY Z _ K AO L _ S T EH L AH .
I was so nervous. :: AY _ W AA Z _ S OW _ N ER V AH S .
One was a lawyer. :: W AH N _ W AA Z _ AH _ L AO Y ER .
It's nice to hear. :: IH T S _ N AY S _ T UW _ HH IY R .
Who would be right? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ B IY _ R AY T ?
They were too hard. :: DH EY _ W ER _ T UW _ HH AA R D .
It is a lifeline. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ L AY F L AY N .
Tell us about it. :: T EH L _ AH S _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
It is marvellous. :: IH T _ IH Z _ M AA R V AH L AH S .
I've got the shirt. :: AY V _ G AA T _ DH AH _ SH ER T .
I was in a hole. :: AY _ W AA Z _ IH N _ AH _ HH OW L .
There is no link. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ L IH NG K .
I can see it now. :: AY _ K AE N _ S IY _ IH T _ N AW .
Is that Titanic? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ T AY T AE N IH K ?
A team is a team. :: AH _ T IY M _ IH Z _ AH _ T IY M .
Is a drug dealer? :: IH Z _ AH _ D R AH G _ D IY L ER ?
Is that an issue? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ AE N _ IH SH UW ?
It should be easy. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY _ IY Z IY .
It looks that way. :: IH T _ L UH K S _ DH AE T _ W EY .
In a way he was. :: IH N _ AH _ W EY _ HH IY _ W AA Z .
He is fully fit. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ F UH L IY _ F IH T .
I knew the script. :: AY _ N UW _ DH AH _ S K R IH P T .
We are all equal. :: W IY _ AA R _ AO L _ IY K W AH L .
Life is too short. :: L AY F _ IH Z _ T UW _ SH AO R T .
Who has he fought? :: HH UW _ HH AE Z _ HH IY _ F AO T ?
This is the band. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ B AE N D .
He had a horror. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ HH AO R ER .
The night is young. :: DH AH _ N AY T _ IH Z _ Y AH NG .
It got no better. :: IH T _ G AA T _ N OW _ B EH T ER .
Of course he does! :: AH V _ K AO R S _ HH IY _ D AH Z !
I made a mistake. :: AY _ M EY D _ AH _ M IH S T EY K .
I always said No. :: AY _ AO L W EY Z _ S EH D _ N OW .
It is three years. :: IH T _ IH Z _ TH R IY _ Y IH R Z .
The goal is clear. :: DH AH _ G OW L _ IH Z _ K L IH R .
What would you ask? :: W AH T _ W UH D _ Y UW _ AE S K ?
This is your life. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ Y AO R _ L AY F .
It's all too early. :: IH T S _ AO L _ T UW _ ER L IY .
I believe in God. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ G AA D .
It will carry on. :: IH T _ W IH L _ K AE R IY _ AA N .
He will be missed. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ B IY _ M IH S T .
It's not the tour. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ DH AH _ T UH R .
Then it will come. :: DH EH N _ IH T _ W IH L _ K AH M .
I don't think so. :: AY _ D OW N T _ TH IH NG K _ S OW .
His film is not. :: HH IH Z _ F IH L M _ IH Z _ N AA T .
That is good news. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ G UH D _ N UW Z .
He is not alone. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH L OW N .
It has no chance. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ N OW _ CH AE N S .
I live for today. :: AY _ L AY V _ F AO R _ T AH D EY .
It was great fun. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ G R EY T _ F AH N .
Are these immoral? :: AA R _ DH IY Z _ IH M AO R AH L ?
We need to think. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ TH IH NG K .
And well he might. :: AH N D _ W EH L _ HH IY _ M AY T .
I was an athlete. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AE N _ AE TH L IY T .
Is that an issue? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ AE N _ IH SH UW ?
It wasn't to be. :: IH T _ W AA Z AH N T _ T UW _ B IY .
I was very young. :: AY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ Y AH NG .
He is in the US. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ AH S .
My office is bare. :: M AY _ AO F AH S _ IH Z _ B EH R .
Work has started. :: W ER K _ HH AE Z _ S T AA R T AH D .
Hartley should know. :: HH AA R T L IY _ SH UH D _ N OW .
That set the tone. :: DH AE T _ S EH T _ DH AH _ T OW N .
It's a real threat. :: IH T S _ AH _ R IY L _ TH R EH T .
He takes the job. :: HH IY _ T EY K S _ DH AH _ JH AA B .
LET there be light. :: L EH T _ DH EH R _ B IY _ L AY T .
Something is wrong. :: S AH M TH IH NG _ IH Z _ R AO NG .
You feel the pride. :: Y UW _ F IY L _ DH AH _ P R AY D .
He talks too much. :: HH IY _ T AO K S _ T UW _ M AH CH .
Is that possible? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ P AA S AH B AH L ?
It's too much work. :: IH T S _ T UW _ M AH CH _ W ER K .
You make the choice. :: Y UW _ M EY K _ DH AH _ CH OY S .
The door is open. :: DH AH _ D AO R _ IH Z _ OW P AH N .
Was it a signal? :: W AA Z _ IH T _ AH _ S IH G N AH L ?
It's hard not to. :: IH T S _ HH AA R D _ N AA T _ T UW .
I haven't a clue. :: AY _ HH AE V AH N T _ AH _ K L UW .
Do you mean today? :: D UW _ Y UW _ M IY N _ T AH D EY ?
It was a sell-out. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ S EH L AW T .
It makes no sense. :: IH T _ M EY K S _ N OW _ S EH N S .
Were they under-age? :: W ER _ DH EY _ AH N D ER EY JH ?
The goal will come. :: DH AH _ G OW L _ W IH L _ K AH M .
It's just so sad. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ S OW _ S AE D .
They were that poor. :: DH EY _ W ER _ DH AE T _ P UH R .
It is a technique. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ T EH K N IY K .
She is an angel. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ AE N _ EY N JH AH L .
It is a scandal. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ S K AE N D AH L .
It is a dilemma. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ D IH L EH M AH .
It's just for me. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ F AO R _ M IY .
I'd never be free. :: AY D _ N EH V ER _ B IY _ F R IY .
I am not a liar. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ AH _ L AY ER .
What is going on? :: W AH T _ IH Z _ G OW IH NG _ AA N ?
Yet there is hope. :: Y EH T _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ HH OW P .
The time was right. :: DH AH _ T AY M _ W AA Z _ R AY T .
It's just a fact. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ AH _ F AE K T .
The cause is just. :: DH AH _ K AA Z _ IH Z _ JH AH S T .
That has now gone. :: DH AE T _ HH AE Z _ N AW _ G AO N .
That was worth it. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ W ER TH _ IH T .
Those were the days. :: DH OW Z _ W ER _ DH AH _ D EY Z .
It is an outrage. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AE N _ AW T R EY JH .
You don't see that. :: Y UW _ D OW N T _ S IY _ DH AE T .
What do you think? :: W AH T _ D UW _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K ?
It's not my fault. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ M AY _ F AO L T .
We are moving on. :: W IY _ AA R _ M UW V IH NG _ AA N .
That's a good sign. :: DH AE T S _ AH _ G UH D _ S AY N .
What has happened? :: W AH T _ HH AE Z _ HH AE P AH N D ?
It is a step up. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ S T EH P _ AH P .
It's a good start. :: IH T S _ AH _ G UH D _ S T AA R T .
She has been shot. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ SH AA T .
It's in his blood. :: IH T S _ IH N _ HH IH Z _ B L AH D .
You are the glory. :: Y UW _ AA R _ DH AH _ G L AO R IY .
The goals were good. :: DH AH _ G OW L Z _ W ER _ G UH D .
It is unusual. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH N Y UW ZH AH W AH L .
It's a great thing. :: IH T S _ AH _ G R EY T _ TH IH NG .
Well, he should know. :: W EH L , HH IY _ SH UH D _ N OW .
She had black eyes. :: SH IY _ HH AE D _ B L AE K _ AY Z .
Admission is free. :: AE D M IH SH AH N _ IH Z _ F R IY .
Bill is a mentor. :: B IH L _ IH Z _ AH _ M EH N T AO R .
He had no answer. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ AE N S ER .
I am very shocked. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ SH AA K T .
Do it for us now. :: D UW _ IH T _ F AO R _ AH S _ N AW .
Subtle it is not. :: S AH T AH L _ IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T .
It was a big day. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ B IH G _ D EY .
It's a grey area. :: IH T S _ AH _ G R EY _ EH R IY AH .
Would you take them? :: W UH D _ Y UW _ T EY K _ DH EH M ?
It may be argued. :: IH T _ M EY _ B IY _ AA R G Y UW D .
I want to go now. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ G OW _ N AW .
This is new money. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N UW _ M AH N IY .
One thing is sure. :: W AH N _ TH IH NG _ IH Z _ SH UH R .
I feel really good. :: AY _ F IY L _ R IH L IY _ G UH D .
That should be fun. :: DH AE T _ SH UH D _ B IY _ F AH N .
What were they told? :: W AH T _ W ER _ DH EY _ T OW L D ?
It was a classic. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ K L AE S IH K .
What then is wrong? :: W AH T _ DH EH N _ IH Z _ R AO NG ?
He was very fit. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ F IH T .
They said they would. :: DH EY _ S EH D _ DH EY _ W UH D .
We were all afraid. :: W IY _ W ER _ AO L _ AH F R EY D .
The lady is right. :: DH AH _ L EY D IY _ IH Z _ R AY T .
He was a soldier. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ S OW L JH ER .
The answer is yes. :: DH AH _ AE N S ER _ IH Z _ Y EH S .
I am very happy. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ HH AE P IY .
She had no chance. :: SH IY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ CH AE N S .
As indeed it did. :: AE Z _ IH N D IY D _ IH T _ D IH D .
So what's in store? :: S OW _ W AH T S _ IH N _ S T AO R ?
The best team won. :: DH AH _ B EH S T _ T IY M _ W AH N .
It was so unfair. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S OW _ AH N F EH R .
Where do you start? :: W EH R _ D UW _ Y UW _ S T AA R T ?
It's like a garage. :: IH T S _ L AY K _ AH _ G ER AA ZH .
He should have won. :: HH IY _ SH UH D _ HH AE V _ W AH N .
Kids are terrible. :: K IH D Z _ AA R _ T EH R AH B AH L .
It is a time bomb. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ T AY M _ B AA M .
I could not do it. :: AY _ K UH D _ N AA T _ D UW _ IH T .
That's the day job. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ D EY _ JH AA B .
It's all I can do. :: IH T S _ AO L _ AY _ K AE N _ D UW .
He told the court. :: HH IY _ T OW L D _ DH AH _ K AO R T .
It has to be now. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ B IY _ N AW .
She looked so young. :: SH IY _ L UH K T _ S OW _ Y AH NG .
It is no surprise. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N OW _ S ER P R AY Z .
Maybe she is right. :: M EY B IY _ SH IY _ IH Z _ R AY T .
It's not a U-turn. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ AH P T ER N .
That is really all. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ R IH L IY _ AO L .
The book is closed. :: DH AH _ B UH K _ IH Z _ K L OW Z D .
It's a killer piece. :: IH T S _ AH _ K IH L ER _ P IY S .
Maloney was asked. :: M AH L OW N IY _ W AA Z _ AE S K T .
It's a true story. :: IH T S _ AH _ T R UW _ S T AO R IY .
I'm very grateful. :: AY M _ V EH R IY _ G R EY T F AH L .
Nato will prevail. :: N EY T OW _ W IH L _ P R IH V EY L .
We cannot lose it. :: W IY _ K AE N AA T _ L UW Z _ IH T .
Don't get me wrong. :: D OW N T _ G EH T _ M IY _ R AO NG .
They agree to meet. :: DH EY _ AH G R IY _ T UW _ M IY T .
It was an ambush. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ AE M B UH SH .
I agree with them. :: AY _ AH G R IY _ W IH DH _ DH EH M .
They are all Arabs. :: DH EY _ AA R _ AO L _ AE R AH B Z .
He was a legend. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ L EH JH AH N D .
Now there's a thought. :: N AW _ DH EH R Z _ AH _ TH AO T .
It seems very odd. :: IH T _ S IY M Z _ V EH R IY _ AA D .
My life is a mess. :: M AY _ L AY F _ IH Z _ AH _ M EH S .
The stakes are high. :: DH AH _ S T EY K S _ AA R _ HH AY .
They could not hear. :: DH EY _ K UH D _ N AA T _ HH IY R .
We still don't know. :: W IY _ S T IH L _ D OW N T _ N OW .
People are fed up. :: P IY P AH L _ AA R _ F EH D _ AH P .
He was not alone. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH L OW N .
What we were doing. :: W AH T _ W IY _ W ER _ D UW IH NG .
We're not that bad. :: W IY R _ N AA T _ DH AE T _ B AE D .
This is great news. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ G R EY T _ N UW Z .
He can be beaten. :: HH IY _ K AE N _ B IY _ B IY T AH N .
They were his words. :: DH EY _ W ER _ HH IH Z _ W ER D Z .
It was good today. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ G UH D _ T AH D EY .
He knows the course. :: HH IY _ N OW Z _ DH AH _ K AO R S .
He was a one off. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ W AH N _ AO F .
What's the problem? :: W AH T S _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M ?
They will be ready. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ B IY _ R EH D IY .
It's worth it, though. :: IH T S _ W ER TH _ IH T , DH OW .
It is a fantasy. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ F AE N T AH S IY .
It is his script. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH IH Z _ S K R IH P T .
I was so relieved. :: AY _ W AA Z _ S OW _ R IH L IY V D .
So what went wrong? :: S OW _ W AH T _ W EH N T _ R AO NG ?
I sit in the car. :: AY _ S IH T _ IH N _ DH AH _ K AA R .
He was in a mood. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ IH N _ AH _ M UW D .
It's a good story. :: IH T S _ AH _ G UH D _ S T AO R IY .
It's a way of life. :: IH T S _ AH _ W EY _ AH V _ L AY F .
I feel pretty good. :: AY _ F IY L _ P R IH T IY _ G UH D .
It changed my life. :: IH T _ CH EY N JH D _ M AY _ L AY F .
We should have known. :: W IY _ SH UH D _ HH AE V _ N OW N .
And we can do it. :: AH N D _ W IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ IH T .
We were on our way. :: W IY _ W ER _ AA N _ AW ER _ W EY .
I am a lucky man. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ L AH K IY _ M AE N .
It was the eighties. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ EY T IY Z .
This is a sad day. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ S AE D _ D EY .
The goals will come. :: DH AH _ G OW L Z _ W IH L _ K AH M .
I am very angry. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ AE NG G R IY .
They had better be. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ B EH T ER _ B IY .
One must hope not! :: W AH N _ M AH S T _ HH OW P _ N AA T !
It is on the news. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ N UW Z .
These days are past. :: DH IY Z _ D EY Z _ AA R _ P AE S T .
It was very fast. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ F AE S T .
O, Is he conscious? :: OW , IH Z _ HH IY _ K AA N SH AH S ?
It raises the edge. :: IH T _ R EY Z AH Z _ DH AH _ EH JH .
You're going to die. :: Y UH R _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ D AY .
On that they agree. :: AA N _ DH AE T _ DH EY _ AH G R IY .
plays in dark blue. :: P L EY Z _ IH N _ D AA R K _ B L UW .
We will meet again. :: W IY _ W IH L _ M IY T _ AH G EH N .
They've two children. :: DH EY V _ T UW _ CH IH L D R AH N .
There are big names. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ B IH G _ N EY M Z .
Look at the table. :: L UH K _ AE T _ DH AH _ T EY B AH L .
It's such a trial! :: IH T S _ S AH CH _ AH _ T R AY AH L !
Can you believe it? :: K AE N _ Y UW _ B IH L IY V _ IH T ?
It wouldn't go off. :: IH T _ W UH D AH N T _ G OW _ AO F .
That was me today. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ M IY _ T AH D EY .
And then he laughs. :: AH N D _ DH EH N _ HH IY _ L AE F S .
What happens next? :: W AH T _ HH AE P AH N Z _ N EH K S T ?
I mean it happens. :: AY _ M IY N _ IH T _ HH AE P AH N Z .
What's a boy to do? :: W AH T S _ AH _ B OY _ T UW _ D UW ?
I can't believe it. :: AY _ K AE N T _ B IH L IY V _ IH T .
He wouldn't do it. :: HH IY _ W UH D AH N T _ D UW _ IH T .
This must be wrong. :: DH IH S _ M AH S T _ B IY _ R AO NG .
It is best value. :: IH T _ IH Z _ B EH S T _ V AE L Y UW .
It was an insult. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ IH N S AH L T .
We were very close. :: W IY _ W ER _ V EH R IY _ K L OW S .
What does that mean? :: W AH T _ D AH Z _ DH AE T _ M IY N ?
Why does he do it? :: W AY _ D AH Z _ HH IY _ D UW _ IH T ?
One thing is clear. :: W AH N _ TH IH NG _ IH Z _ K L IH R .
IT had to happen. :: IH T _ HH AE D _ T UW _ HH AE P AH N .
I am ready to go. :: AY _ AE M _ R EH D IY _ T UW _ G OW .
These days are over. :: DH IY Z _ D EY Z _ AA R _ OW V ER .
So you let me know. :: S OW _ Y UW _ L EH T _ M IY _ N OW .
Who would have known. :: HH UW _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ N OW N .
Is she in trouble? :: IH Z _ SH IY _ IH N _ T R AH B AH L ?
It is not simple. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ S IH M P AH L .
You can never tell. :: Y UW _ K AE N _ N EH V ER _ T EH L .
That took two weeks. :: DH AE T _ T UH K _ T UW _ W IY K S .
This is a classic. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ K L AE S IH K .
The baby was dead. :: DH AH _ B EY B IY _ W AA Z _ D EH D .
What does this mean? :: W AH T _ D AH Z _ DH IH S _ M IY N ?
But it's the truth. :: B AH T _ IH T S _ DH AH _ T R UW TH .
It is very funny. :: IH T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ F AH N IY .
I don't know, really. :: AY _ D OW N T _ N OW , R IH L IY .
But it is a fact. :: B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ F AE K T .
I am enjoying it. :: AY _ AE M _ EH N JH OY IH NG _ IH T .
I was close enough. :: AY _ W AA Z _ K L OW S _ IH N AH F .
It was just great. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ G R EY T .
It was a nightmare. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ N AY T M EH R .
I chose the former. :: AY _ CH OW Z _ DH AH _ F AO R M ER .
That was about it. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
We are in the hat. :: W IY _ AA R _ IH N _ DH AH _ HH AE T .
It can be halted. :: IH T _ K AE N _ B IY _ HH AO L T AH D .
It's never too late. :: IH T S _ N EH V ER _ T UW _ L EY T .
They are never here. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N EH V ER _ HH IY R .
I did not name it. :: AY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ N EY M _ IH T .
Graeme was prepared. :: G R EY M _ W AA Z _ P R IY P EH R D .
I knew he was good. :: AY _ N UW _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ G UH D .
It should be equal. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY _ IY K W AH L .
I was just a kid. :: AY _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AH _ K IH D .
If you can get it. :: IH F _ Y UW _ K AE N _ G EH T _ IH T .
It is not like us. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ L AY K _ AH S .
They did very well. :: DH EY _ D IH D _ V EH R IY _ W EH L .
But it was a loss. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ L AO S .
It is nearly there. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N IH R L IY _ DH EH R .
Souter will be back. :: S UW T ER _ W IH L _ B IY _ B AE K .
Their time has gone. :: DH EH R _ T AY M _ HH AE Z _ G AO N .
They need the money. :: DH EY _ N IY D _ DH AH _ M AH N IY .
He would add value. :: HH IY _ W UH D _ AE D _ V AE L Y UW .
The mood is upbeat. :: DH AH _ M UW D _ IH Z _ AH P B IY T .
Is Saddam a threat? :: IH Z _ S AA D AH M _ AH _ TH R EH T ?
Neil knows the score. :: N IY L _ N OW Z _ DH AH _ S K AO R .
Wealth is relative. :: W EH L TH _ IH Z _ R EH L AH T IH V .
I will work on her. :: AY _ W IH L _ W ER K _ AA N _ HH ER .
I have got a knife. :: AY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ AH _ N AY F .
A venue was found. :: AH _ V EH N Y UW _ W AA Z _ F AW N D .
It's unfair on her. :: IH T S _ AH N F EH R _ AA N _ HH ER .
It's a great idea. :: IH T S _ AH _ G R EY T _ AY D IY AH .
He also admitted. :: HH IY _ AO L S OW _ AH D M IH T AH D .
The order went out. :: DH AH _ AO R D ER _ W EH N T _ AW T .
This is your chance. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ Y AO R _ CH AE N S .
It was not a foul. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH _ F AW L .
It was a takeover. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ T EY K OW V ER .
He changed my life. :: HH IY _ CH EY N JH D _ M AY _ L AY F .
There is still hope. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ HH OW P .
He, too, is killing. :: HH IY , T UW , IH Z _ K IH L IH NG .
This was much worse. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ M AH CH _ W ER S .
The film was great. :: DH AH _ F IH L M _ W AA Z _ G R EY T .
So, what's it about? :: S OW , W AH T S _ IH T _ AH B AW T ?
That is the crunch. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K R AH N CH .
What's it all about? :: W AH T S _ IH T _ AO L _ AH B AW T ?
This is my music. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ M AY _ M Y UW Z IH K .
Who wouldn't do it? :: HH UW _ W UH D AH N T _ D UW _ IH T ?
It was very close. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ K L OW S .
It is working well. :: IH T _ IH Z _ W ER K IH NG _ W EH L .
Things are on track. :: TH IH NG Z _ AA R _ AA N _ T R AE K .
There is no escape. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ IH S K EY P .
And so it goes on. :: AH N D _ S OW _ IH T _ G OW Z _ AA N .
That is the theory. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ TH IH R IY .
And we will do it. :: AH N D _ W IY _ W IH L _ D UW _ IH T .
It's the right thing. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ R AY T _ TH IH NG .
It's getting to me. :: IH T S _ G EH T IH NG _ T UW _ M IY .
I am a socialist. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ S OW SH AH L AH S T .
It was up to him. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH P _ T UW _ HH IH M .
I know he meant it. :: AY _ N OW _ HH IY _ M EH N T _ IH T .
This is a business. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ B IH Z N AH S .
That's how it works. :: DH AE T S _ HH AW _ IH T _ W ER K S .
So, how did you do? :: S OW , HH AW _ D IH D _ Y UW _ D UW ?
It's an old story. :: IH T S _ AE N _ OW L D _ S T AO R IY .
It goes in cycles. :: IH T _ G OW Z _ IH N _ S AY K AH L Z .
That is bad enough. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ B AE D _ IH N AH F .
It was not pretty. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ P R IH T IY .
You can't have both. :: Y UW _ K AE N T _ HH AE V _ B OW TH .
He is in the queue. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ K Y UW .
It is a court case. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ K AO R T _ K EY S .
You did not see it. :: Y UW _ D IH D _ N AA T _ S IY _ IH T .
That's no bad thing. :: DH AE T S _ N OW _ B AE D _ TH IH NG .
This is the window. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ W IH N D OW .
We just had a go. :: W IY _ JH AH S T _ HH AE D _ AH _ G OW .
If I was a woman. :: IH F _ AY _ W AA Z _ AH _ W UH M AH N .
I can't get a job. :: AY _ K AE N T _ G EH T _ AH _ JH AA B .
I've got no secret. :: AY V _ G AA T _ N OW _ S IY K R AH T .
I came to complete. :: AY _ K EY M _ T UW _ K AH M P L IY T .
I must take a seat. :: AY _ M AH S T _ T EY K _ AH _ S IY T .
There was an e-mail. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AE N _ IY M EY L .
They were fantastic. :: DH EY _ W ER _ F AE N T AE S T IH K .
And I saw the light! :: AH N D _ AY _ S AO _ DH AH _ L AY T !
I want a free vote. :: AY _ W AA N T _ AH _ F R IY _ V OW T .
He did better then. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ B EH T ER _ DH EH N .
I am a good player. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ G UH D _ P L EY ER .
It came a bit late. :: IH T _ K EY M _ AH _ B IH T _ L EY T .
No, but my wife is. :: N OW , B AH T _ M AY _ W AY F _ IH Z .
That has been lost. :: DH AE T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ L AO S T .
It was little else. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ L IH T AH L _ EH L S .
They are the heroes. :: DH EY _ AA R _ DH AH _ HH IH R OW Z .
I have no secrets. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N OW _ S IY K R AH T S .
Maybe it helps us. :: M EY B IY _ IH T _ HH EH L P S _ AH S .
This makes no sense! :: DH IH S _ M EY K S _ N OW _ S EH N S !
I'm pleased for him. :: AY M _ P L IY Z D _ F AO R _ HH IH M .
What will they called? :: W AH T _ W IH L _ DH EY _ K AO L D ?
And the winners are. :: AH N D _ DH AH _ W IH N ER Z _ AA R .
I think it's awful. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T S _ AA F AH L .
That is of no use. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AH V _ N OW _ Y UW S .
We keep a distance. :: W IY _ K IY P _ AH _ D IH S T AH N S .
I've got the poster. :: AY V _ G AA T _ DH AH _ P OW S T ER .
This does not help. :: DH IH S _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ HH EH L P .
I didn't feel good. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ F IY L _ G UH D .
It was just awful. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AA F AH L .
I want to go home. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ G OW _ HH OW M .
The Scots are great. :: DH AH _ S K AA T S _ AA R _ G R EY T .
This is the subway. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S AH B W EY .
It was no surprise. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N OW _ S ER P R AY Z .
I thought to myself. :: AY _ TH AO T _ T UW _ M AY S EH L F .
He was very close. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ K L OW S .
Felt good about it. :: F EH L T _ G UH D _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
And it's not funny. :: AH N D _ IH T S _ N AA T _ F AH N IY .
Or so it is hoped. :: AO R _ S OW _ IH T _ IH Z _ HH OW P T .
This is a new era. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ N UW _ EH R AH .
He is walking free. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ W AO K IH NG _ F R IY .
They're all doing it. :: DH EH R _ AO L _ D UW IH NG _ IH T .
I was just aghast. :: AY _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AH G AE S T .
We call it marriage. :: W IY _ K AO L _ IH T _ M EH R IH JH .
It's always the way. :: IH T S _ AO L W EY Z _ DH AH _ W EY .
Who are the public? :: HH UW _ AA R _ DH AH _ P AH B L IH K ?
He's a great dealer. :: HH IY Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ D IY L ER .
We need to regroup. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ R IY G R UW P .
So what did he do? :: S OW _ W AH T _ D IH D _ HH IY _ D UW ?
They've got more time. :: DH EY V _ G AA T _ M AO R _ T AY M .
We have a problem. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
She will do for me. :: SH IY _ W IH L _ D UW _ F AO R _ M IY .
It will be too hot. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ T UW _ HH AA T .
There's a story, too. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ S T AO R IY , T UW .
That will be vital. :: DH AE T _ W IH L _ B IY _ V AY T AH L .
We've got the bronze. :: W IY V _ G AA T _ DH AH _ B R AA N Z .
He did a good job. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ AH _ G UH D _ JH AA B .
That you can do it. :: DH AE T _ Y UW _ K AE N _ D UW _ IH T .
That's all right then. :: DH AE T S _ AO L _ R AY T _ DH EH N .
Off with their heads. :: AO F _ W IH DH _ DH EH R _ HH EH D Z .
I can live with it. :: AY _ K AE N _ L AY V _ W IH DH _ IH T .
My Dad is a hero. :: M AY _ D AE D _ IH Z _ AH _ HH IH R OW .
they fail to engage. :: DH EY _ F EY L _ T UW _ EH N G EY JH .
Well, he can do it. :: W EH L , HH IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ IH T .
And so it went on. :: AH N D _ S OW _ IH T _ W EH N T _ AA N .
I knew Donald Dewar. :: AY _ N UW _ D AA N AH L D _ D UW ER .
He got his degree. :: HH IY _ G AA T _ HH IH Z _ D IH G R IY .
It is a body blow. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ B AA D IY _ B L OW .
He was on a horse. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AA N _ AH _ HH AO R S .
I fell against him. :: AY _ F EH L _ AH G EH N S T _ HH IH M .
Does the name matter? :: D AH Z _ DH AH _ N EY M _ M AE T ER ?
Henry should go now. :: HH EH N R IY _ SH UH D _ G OW _ N AW .
We learned two things. :: W IY _ L ER N D _ T UW _ TH IH NG Z .
The tie isn't over. :: DH AH _ T AY _ IH Z AH N T _ OW V ER .
There was a vacuum. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ V AE K Y UW M .
It is not a threat. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ TH R EH T .
We have got a race. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ AH _ R EY S .
My dad is all right. :: M AY _ D AE D _ IH Z _ AO L _ R AY T .
No-one else was hurt. :: _ N UW N _ EH L S _ W AA Z _ HH ER T .
Europe is a bonus. :: Y UH R AH P _ IH Z _ AH _ B OW N AH S .
That, though, was then. :: DH AE T , DH OW , W AA Z _ DH EH N .
He, too, will return. :: HH IY , T UW , W IH L _ R IH T ER N .
I had to calm down. :: AY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ K AA M _ D AW N .
Of course we aren't. :: AH V _ K AO R S _ W IY _ AA R AH N T .
It is not illegal. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ IH L IY G AH L .
He had a moustache. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ M AH S T AE SH .
You saw the football. :: Y UW _ S AO _ DH AH _ F UH T B AO L .
We have worked hard. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ W ER K T _ HH AA R D .
His voice is strong. :: HH IH Z _ V OY S _ IH Z _ S T R AO NG .
I've grown up a bit. :: AY V _ G R OW N _ AH P _ AH _ B IH T .
She wanted to move. :: SH IY _ W AA N T AH D _ T UW _ M UW V .
Pray that it is so. :: P R EY _ DH AE T _ IH T _ IH Z _ S OW .
It was a disaster. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ D IH Z AE S T ER .
Was that not awful? :: W AA Z _ DH AE T _ N AA T _ AA F AH L ?
I will be standing. :: AY _ W IH L _ B IY _ S T AE N D IH NG .
I hope he gets it. :: AY _ HH OW P _ HH IY _ G EH T S _ IH T .
These were the dreams. :: DH IY Z _ W ER _ DH AH _ D R IY M Z .
There is a problem. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
Wouldn't it be nice? :: W UH D AH N T _ IH T _ B IY _ N AY S ?
It runs in cycles. :: IH T _ R AH N Z _ IH N _ S AY K AH L Z .
I still hope to go. :: AY _ S T IH L _ HH OW P _ T UW _ G OW .
I'm working on that. :: AY M _ W ER K IH NG _ AA N _ DH AE T .
I am not a doctor. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ AH _ D AA K T ER .
You have been warned. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ W AO R N D .
We had a good time. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ G UH D _ T AY M .
Which is fair enough. :: W IH CH _ IH Z _ F EH R _ IH N AH F .
There he goes again. :: DH EH R _ HH IY _ G OW Z _ AH G EH N .
You find it bizarre? :: Y UW _ F AY N D _ IH T _ B AH Z AA R ?
And maybe they have. :: AH N D _ M EY B IY _ DH EY _ HH AE V .
It was looking bad. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ L UH K IH NG _ B AE D .
No one was injured. :: N OW _ W AH N _ W AA Z _ IH N JH ER D .
And he's not alone. :: AH N D _ HH IY Z _ N AA T _ AH L OW N .
The pace is telling. :: DH AH _ P EY S _ IH Z _ T EH L IH NG .
He is one of them. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ W AH N _ AH V _ DH EH M .
He was their leader. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ DH EH R _ L IY D ER .
Doesn't he miss it? :: D AH Z AH N T _ HH IY _ M IH S _ IH T ?
Look at the turn-out. :: L UH K _ AE T _ DH AH _ T ER N AW T .
It's not their fault. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ DH EH R _ F AO L T .
He made no comment. :: HH IY _ M EY D _ N OW _ K AA M EH N T .
We are very pleased. :: W IY _ AA R _ V EH R IY _ P L IY Z D .
They are a good team. :: DH EY _ AA R _ AH _ G UH D _ T IY M .
It will be crucial. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ K R UW SH AH L .
Does the name matter? :: D AH Z _ DH AH _ N EY M _ M AE T ER ?
It's quite a routine. :: IH T S _ K W AY T _ AH _ R UW T IY N .
I am immensely sad. :: AY _ AE M _ IH M EH N S L IY _ S AE D .
My body is a wreck. :: M AY _ B AA D IY _ IH Z _ AH _ R EH K .
It is a memorial. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ M AH M AO R IY AH L .
I saw it at a ruck. :: AY _ S AO _ IH T _ AE T _ AH _ R AH K .
It's a long process. :: IH T S _ AH _ L AO NG _ P R AA S EH S .
But it can be done. :: B AH T _ IH T _ K AE N _ B IY _ D AH N .
Again, we were lucky. :: AH G EH N , W IY _ W ER _ L AH K IY .
It's quite a line-up! :: IH T S _ K W AY T _ AH _ L AY N AH P !
We will be homeless. :: W IY _ W IH L _ B IY _ HH OW M L AH S .
There wasn't a goal. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z AH N T _ AH _ G OW L .
It's the only thing. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ OW N L IY _ TH IH NG .
He can do no wrong. :: HH IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ N OW _ R AO NG .
It should be scrapped. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY _ S K R AE P T .
That time has passed. :: DH AE T _ T AY M _ HH AE Z _ P AE S T .
She was at the top. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ AE T _ DH AH _ T AA P .
Dialogue is the key. :: D AY AH L AO G _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K IY .
It would have to be. :: IH T _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ T UW _ B IY .
The car driver died. :: DH AH _ K AA R _ D R AY V ER _ D AY D .
There was no reason. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ R IY Z AH N .
We tried four banks. :: W IY _ T R AY D _ F AO R _ B AE NG K S .
When I was training. :: W EH N _ AY _ W AA Z _ T R EY N IH NG .
Life becomes a song. :: L AY F _ B IH K AH M Z _ AH _ S AO NG .
I recommend a tour. :: AY _ R EH K AH M EH N D _ AH _ T UH R .
We have to expand. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ IH K S P AE N D .
We have big ideas. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ B IH G _ AY D IY AH Z .
Why do it otherwise? :: W AY _ D UW _ IH T _ AH DH ER W AY Z ?
He was really great. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ R IH L IY _ G R EY T .
They should come clean. :: DH EY _ SH UH D _ K AH M _ K L IY N .
Somehow they got out. :: S AH M HH AW _ DH EY _ G AA T _ AW T .
It's a huge amount. :: IH T S _ AH _ HH Y UW JH _ AH M AW N T .
Also, he was flawed. :: AO L S OW , HH IY _ W AA Z _ F L AO D .
We are well insured. :: W IY _ AA R _ W EH L _ IH N SH UH R D .
I am not retiring. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ R IH T AY R IH NG .
But what lies ahead? :: B AH T _ W AH T _ L AY Z _ AH HH EH D ?
They chose the latter. :: DH EY _ CH OW Z _ DH AH _ L AE T ER .
See it while you can. :: S IY _ IH T _ W AY L _ Y UW _ K AE N .
If there is default. :: IH F _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ D IH F AO L T .
I would like Glasgow. :: AY _ W UH D _ L AY K _ G L AE S K OW .
It is a great shame. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ SH EY M .
I'd go to bookshops. :: AY D _ G OW _ T UW _ B UH K SH AA P S .
But who will buy it? :: B AH T _ HH UW _ W IH L _ B AY _ IH T ?
We played too deeply. :: W IY _ P L EY D _ T UW _ D IY P L IY .
No-one should see that. :: _ N UW N _ SH UH D _ S IY _ DH AE T .
She is very upset. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ AH P S EH T .
He was not deterred. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ D IH T ER D .
Don't you believe it. :: D OW N T _ Y UW _ B IH L IY V _ IH T .
We are getting there. :: W IY _ AA R _ G EH T IH NG _ DH EH R .
When will you listen? :: W EH N _ W IH L _ Y UW _ L IH S AH N ?
Was it too obvious? :: W AA Z _ IH T _ T UW _ AA B V IY AH S ?
It's a big mystery. :: IH T S _ AH _ B IH G _ M IH S T ER IY .
Words are not enough. :: W ER D Z _ AA R _ N AA T _ IH N AH F .
It needs a rethink. :: IH T _ N IY D Z _ AH _ R IY TH IH NG K .
If only it were so. :: IH F _ OW N L IY _ IH T _ W ER _ S OW .
I am very relieved. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ R IH L IY V D .
We are not with you. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ W IH DH _ Y UW .
The answer is maybe. :: DH AH _ AE N S ER _ IH Z _ M EY B IY .
It's really good fun. :: IH T S _ R IH L IY _ G UH D _ F AH N .
It went on forever. :: IH T _ W EH N T _ AA N _ F ER EH V ER .
It is time, he said. :: IH T _ IH Z _ T AY M , HH IY _ S EH D .
It was time to act. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T AY M _ T UW _ AE K T .
Rangers are my life. :: R EY N JH ER Z _ AA R _ M AY _ L AY F .
Now it was serious. :: N AW _ IH T _ W AA Z _ S IH R IY AH S .
It is quite simple. :: IH T _ IH Z _ K W AY T _ S IH M P AH L .
That was the theory. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ TH IH R IY .
I would not do that. :: AY _ W UH D _ N AA T _ D UW _ DH AE T .
What's the difference? :: W AH T S _ DH AH _ D IH F ER AH N S ?
The answer was wrong. :: DH AH _ AE N S ER _ W AA Z _ R AO NG .
They are used to it. :: DH EY _ AA R _ Y UW Z D _ T UW _ IH T .
That is for certain. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ F AO R _ S ER T AH N .
Sadly, they did not. :: S AE D L IY , DH EY _ D IH D _ N AA T .
I welcome this Bill. :: AY _ W EH L K AH M _ DH IH S _ B IH L .
The gap is closing. :: DH AH _ G AE P _ IH Z _ K L OW Z IH NG .
And there are others. :: AH N D _ DH EH R _ AA R _ AH DH ER Z .
The timing is wrong. :: DH AH _ T AY M IH NG _ IH Z _ R AO NG .
The net is closing. :: DH AH _ N EH T _ IH Z _ K L OW Z IH NG .
This is a great day. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ D EY .
It is just so sad. :: IH T _ IH Z _ JH AH S T _ S OW _ S AE D .
It was a close call. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ K L OW S _ K AO L .
It is hard to tell. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH AA R D _ T UW _ T EH L .
There is no plan B. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ P L AE N _ B IY .
He had no enemies. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ EH N AH M IY Z .
I am now unemployed. :: AY _ AE M _ N AW _ AH N EH M P L OY D .
There was no option. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ AA P SH AH N .
Why do it otherwise? :: W AY _ D UW _ IH T _ AH DH ER W AY Z ?
They will run a mile. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ R AH N _ AH _ M AY L .
It's not long enough. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ L AO NG _ IH N AH F .
This is a big club. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ B IH G _ K L AH B .
It is close to call. :: IH T _ IH Z _ K L OW S _ T UW _ K AO L .
That deal is a joke. :: DH AE T _ D IY L _ IH Z _ AH _ JH OW K .
It is not real life. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ R IY L _ L AY F .
They have to be met. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ B IY _ M EH T .
Then came the crunch. :: DH EH N _ K EY M _ DH AH _ K R AH N CH .
It is not a story. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ S T AO R IY .
I had a ball today. :: AY _ HH AE D _ AH _ B AO L _ T AH D EY .
My duty is to win. :: M AY _ D UW T IY _ IH Z _ T UW _ W IH N .
He may have a point. :: HH IY _ M EY _ HH AE V _ AH _ P OY N T .
Tell it like it was? :: T EH L _ IH T _ L AY K _ IH T _ W AA Z ?
And they had a case. :: AH N D _ DH EY _ HH AE D _ AH _ K EY S .
It is not an issue. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AE N _ IH SH UW .
It is a love affair. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ L AH V _ AH F EH R .
It's a real problem. :: IH T S _ AH _ R IY L _ P R AA B L AH M .
She reflects a bit. :: SH IY _ R IH F L EH K T S _ AH _ B IH T .
The people will come. :: DH AH _ P IY P AH L _ W IH L _ K AH M .
There is no excuse. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ IH K S K Y UW S .
So is that it, then? :: S OW _ IH Z _ DH AE T _ IH T , DH EH N ?
Others get through it. :: AH DH ER Z _ G EH T _ TH R UW _ IH T .
Only one got through. :: OW N L IY _ W AH N _ G AA T _ TH R UW .
He deserved the win. :: HH IY _ D IH Z ER V D _ DH AH _ W IH N .
That's all I can say. :: DH AE T S _ AO L _ AY _ K AE N _ S EY .
I would not say that. :: AY _ W UH D _ N AA T _ S EY _ DH AE T .
It is far too early. :: IH T _ IH Z _ F AA R _ T UW _ ER L IY .
He had come of age. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ K AH M _ AH V _ EY JH .
Sub Not Used, McKay. :: S AH B _ N AA T _ Y UW Z D , M AH K EY .
He was just awesome. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AA S AH M .
Who is the employer? :: HH UW _ IH Z _ DH AH _ EH M P L OY ER ?
We can only go up. :: W IY _ K AE N _ OW N L IY _ G OW _ AH P .
So what does one do? :: S OW _ W AH T _ D AH Z _ W AH N _ D UW ?
That's an old idea. :: DH AE T S _ AE N _ OW L D _ AY D IY AH .
I want to keep him. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ K IY P _ HH IH M .
That will not change. :: DH AE T _ W IH L _ N AA T _ CH EY N JH .
I was not a joiner. :: AY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH _ JH OY N ER .
Two people have died. :: T UW _ P IY P AH L _ HH AE V _ D AY D .
I can't describe it. :: AY _ K AE N T _ D IH S K R AY B _ IH T .
Well, there is a bed. :: W EH L , DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ B EH D .
Family, if you like. :: F AE M AH L IY , IH F _ Y UW _ L AY K .
Is that where we are? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ W EH R _ W IY _ AA R ?
The plot is simple. :: DH AH _ P L AA T _ IH Z _ S IH M P AH L .
That wasn't for me. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z AH N T _ F AO R _ M IY .
It is so damaging. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S OW _ D AE M IH JH IH NG .
But summer is spent. :: B AH T _ S AH M ER _ IH Z _ S P EH N T .
It was all over now. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AO L _ OW V ER _ N AW .
We are still waiting. :: W IY _ AA R _ S T IH L _ W EY T IH NG .
The enemy was time. :: DH AH _ EH N AH M IY _ W AA Z _ T AY M .
The memory is there. :: DH AH _ M EH M ER IY _ IH Z _ DH EH R .
They want that school. :: DH EY _ W AA N T _ DH AE T _ S K UW L .
It was one New Year. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ W AH N _ N UW _ Y IH R .

We are all suffering. :: W IY _ AA R _ AO L _ S AH F ER IH NG .
My whole family is. :: M AY _ HH OW L _ F AE M AH L IY _ IH Z .
I grew up with them. :: AY _ G R UW _ AH P _ W IH DH _ DH EH M .
We deserved the draw. :: W IY _ D IH Z ER V D _ DH AH _ D R AO .
But it was too late. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ L EY T .
I have learned a lot. :: AY _ HH AE V _ L ER N D _ AH _ L AA T .
That is a tragedy. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AH _ T R AE JH AH D IY .
As good as they come. :: AE Z _ G UH D _ AE Z _ DH EY _ K AH M .
He knows he is good. :: HH IY _ N OW Z _ HH IY _ IH Z _ G UH D .
It must not happen. :: IH T _ M AH S T _ N AA T _ HH AE P AH N .
That would be unsafe. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ B IY _ AH N S EY F .

You need a trademark. :: Y UW _ N IY D _ AH _ T R EY D M AA R K .
If you could find it. :: IH F _ Y UW _ K UH D _ F AY N D _ IH T .
It's hard to see it. :: IH T S _ HH AA R D _ T UW _ S IY _ IH T .
It looks like a hit. :: IH T _ L UH K S _ L AY K _ AH _ HH IH T .
But I know the course. :: B AH T _ AY _ N OW _ DH AH _ K AO R S .
It's nice to be nice. :: IH T S _ N AY S _ T UW _ B IY _ N AY S .
I was just a child. :: AY _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AH _ CH AY L D .
That is far too high. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ F AA R _ T UW _ HH AY .
But it is up again. :: B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ AH P _ AH G EH N .
And we might go back. :: AH N D _ W IY _ M AY T _ G OW _ B AE K .
Tell it like it was? :: T EH L _ IH T _ L AY K _ IH T _ W AA Z ?
That will do for me. :: DH AE T _ W IH L _ D UW _ F AO R _ M IY .
I was totally wrong. :: AY _ W AA Z _ T OW T AH L IY _ R AO NG .
It's just outrageous. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ AW T R EY JH AH S .
He is a good friend. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ G UH D _ F R EH N D .
New York is my home. :: N UW _ Y AO R K _ IH Z _ M AY _ HH OW M .
It is a strong case. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ S T R AO NG _ K EY S .
We had a great time. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ G R EY T _ T AY M .
It's just not funny! :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ N AA T _ F AH N IY !
It is not a U-turn. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ AH P T ER N .
It's not before time. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ B IH F AO R _ T AY M .
Look at a computer. :: L UH K _ AE T _ AH _ K AH M P Y UW T ER .
This is far too high. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ F AA R _ T UW _ HH AY .
There's always a case. :: DH EH R Z _ AO L W EY Z _ AH _ K EY S .
We enjoyed it today. :: W IY _ EH N JH OY D _ IH T _ T AH D EY .
They are now divorced. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N AW _ D IH V AO R S T .
There was no rescue. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ R EH S K Y UW .
The system can work. :: DH AH _ S IH S T AH M _ K AE N _ W ER K .
We really are a team. :: W IY _ R IH L IY _ AA R _ AH _ T IY M .
It was a hard fight. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH AA R D _ F AY T .
That is not too bad. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ T UW _ B AE D .
It was a crazy day. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ K R EY Z IY _ D EY .
It's not good at all. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ G UH D _ AE T _ AO L .
That was the gimmick. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ G IH M IH K .
When will this change? :: W EH N _ W IH L _ DH IH S _ CH EY N JH ?
Nothing is ruled out. :: N AH TH IH NG _ IH Z _ R UW L D _ AW T .
We are only human. :: W IY _ AA R _ OW N L IY _ HH Y UW M AH N .
We all make mistakes. :: W IY _ AO L _ M EY K _ M IH S T EY K S .
We had our chances. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ AW ER _ CH AE N S AH Z .
It's easy to see why. :: IH T S _ IY Z IY _ T UW _ S IY _ W AY .
We make good weapons. :: W IY _ M EY K _ G UH D _ W EH P AH N Z .

The crowd was awesome. :: DH AH _ K R AW D _ W AA Z _ AA S AH M .
Well, what do you know? :: W EH L , W AH T _ D UW _ Y UW _ N OW ?
And now he tells us. :: AH N D _ N AW _ HH IY _ T EH L Z _ AH S .
It didn't take long. :: IH T _ D IH D AH N T _ T EY K _ L AO NG .
Who cares about that? :: HH UW _ K EH R Z _ AH B AW T _ DH AE T ?

I'm not a magician. :: AY M _ N AA T _ AH _ M AH JH IH SH AH N .
It's a double whammy. :: IH T S _ AH _ D AH B AH L _ W AE M IY .
If so, they were wrong. :: IH F _ S OW , DH EY _ W ER _ R AO NG .
It's typical of me. :: IH T S _ T IH P AH K AH L _ AH V _ M IY .

I just love lessons. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ L AH V _ L EH S AH N Z .
It's time to move on. :: IH T S _ T AY M _ T UW _ M UW V _ AA N .
That's the way it is. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ W EY _ IH T _ IH Z .
It was so physical. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S OW _ F IH Z IH K AH L .

Let's make this clear. :: L EH T S _ M EY K _ DH IH S _ K L IH R .
It's good to be back. :: IH T S _ G UH D _ T UW _ B IY _ B AE K .
It was to no avail. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ N OW _ AH V EY L .
What's the big idea? :: W AH T S _ DH AH _ B IH G _ AY D IY AH ?
It doesn't look good. :: IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ L UH K _ G UH D .
One thing is certain. :: W AH N _ TH IH NG _ IH Z _ S ER T AH N .
That was my mistake. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ M AY _ M IH S T EY K .
I am happy for her. :: AY _ AE M _ HH AE P IY _ F AO R _ HH ER .
And what do we have? :: AH N D _ W AH T _ D UW _ W IY _ HH AE V ?
I knew him a little. :: AY _ N UW _ HH IH M _ AH _ L IH T AH L .
They just have a go. :: DH EY _ JH AH S T _ HH AE V _ AH _ G OW .
He should be careful. :: HH IY _ SH UH D _ B IY _ K EH R F AH L .
Sadly it is a mess. :: S AE D L IY _ IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ M EH S .
The choice is simple. :: DH AH _ CH OY S _ IH Z _ S IH M P AH L .
I was deeply worried. :: AY _ W AA Z _ D IY P L IY _ W ER IY D .
It was quite a sight. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K W AY T _ AH _ S AY T .
That was really tough. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ R IH L IY _ T AH F .
It is so beautiful. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S OW _ B Y UW T AH F AH L .
I certainly hope so. :: AY _ S ER T AH N L IY _ HH OW P _ S OW .
We're talking to him. :: W IY R _ T AO K IH NG _ T UW _ HH IH M .
For tragedy it is. :: F AO R _ T R AE JH AH D IY _ IH T _ IH Z .
They do it properly. :: DH EY _ D UW _ IH T _ P R AA P ER L IY .
It's a real challenge. :: IH T S _ AH _ R IY L _ CH AE L AH N JH .
It is not great art. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ G R EY T _ AA R T .
She is well balanced. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ W EH L _ B AE L AH N S T .
He said she was mad. :: HH IY _ S EH D _ SH IY _ W AA Z _ M AE D .
You might not make it. :: Y UW _ M AY T _ N AA T _ M EY K _ IH T .
It's been a good year. :: IH T S _ B IH N _ AH _ G UH D _ Y IH R .
People have no choice. :: P IY P AH L _ HH AE V _ N OW _ CH OY S .
She died at her home. :: SH IY _ D AY D _ AE T _ HH ER _ HH OW M .
He's been hit by it. :: HH IY Z _ B IH N _ HH IH T _ B AY _ IH T .
I saw the whole thing. :: AY _ S AO _ DH AH _ HH OW L _ TH IH NG .
He is a lovely man. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ L AH V L IY _ M AE N .
We can work all night. :: W IY _ K AE N _ W ER K _ AO L _ N AY T .
And he goes with it. :: AH N D _ HH IY _ G OW Z _ W IH DH _ IH T .
I saw them last week. :: AY _ S AO _ DH EH M _ L AE S T _ W IY K .
He did not say that. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ S EY _ DH AE T .
There was no respite. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ R EH S P IH T .
I got a yellow card. :: AY _ G AA T _ AH _ Y EH L OW _ K AA R D .
He is not a dancer. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ D AE N S ER .
But nothing happened. :: B AH T _ N AH TH IH NG _ HH AE P AH N D .
She is really magic. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ R IH L IY _ M AE JH IH K .

There was no trouble. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ T R AH B AH L .
We are over the moon. :: W IY _ AA R _ OW V ER _ DH AH _ M UW N .
It is just too tough. :: IH T _ IH Z _ JH AH S T _ T UW _ T AH F .
You can cope with it. :: Y UW _ K AE N _ K OW P _ W IH DH _ IH T .
It will set the tone. :: IH T _ W IH L _ S EH T _ DH AH _ T OW N .
They deserved the win. :: DH EY _ D IH Z ER V D _ DH AH _ W IH N .
His name was unknown. :: HH IH Z _ N EY M _ W AA Z _ AH N N OW N .
It was a fairy tale. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ F EH R IY _ T EY L .
IT takes the biscuit. :: IH T _ T EY K S _ DH AH _ B IH S K AH T .
This is my homeland. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ M AY _ HH OW M L AE N D .
It has affected me. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ AH F EH K T AH D _ M IY .
We will do so again. :: W IY _ W IH L _ D UW _ S OW _ AH G EH N .
He quit in October. :: HH IY _ K W IH T _ IH N _ AA K T OW B ER .
We have now no choice. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ N AW _ N OW _ CH OY S .
My mind was made up. :: M AY _ M AY N D _ W AA Z _ M EY D _ AH P .
Or, rather, it isn't. :: AO R , R AE DH ER , IH T _ IH Z AH N T .
This is your country. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ Y AO R _ K AH N T R IY .
It's to do with play. :: IH T S _ T UW _ D UW _ W IH DH _ P L EY .
The urgency is real. :: DH AH _ ER JH AH N S IY _ IH Z _ R IY L .
Too often it is not. :: T UW _ AO F AH N _ IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T .
And here is the rub. :: AH N D _ HH IY R _ IH Z _ DH AH _ R AH B .
Survival is our aim. :: S ER V AY V AH L _ IH Z _ AW ER _ EY M .
At half-time you have? :: AE T _ HH AE F T AY M _ Y UW _ HH AE V ?
This guy is amazing. :: DH IH S _ G AY _ IH Z _ AH M EY Z IH NG .

Well, what can you do? :: W EH L , W AH T _ K AE N _ Y UW _ D UW ?
I fell to the ground. :: AY _ F EH L _ T UW _ DH AH _ G R AW N D .
He is a visionary. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ V IH ZH AH N EH R IY .
This is welcome news. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ W EH L K AH M _ N UW Z .
What's wrong with that? :: W AH T S _ R AO NG _ W IH DH _ DH AE T ?
I was a bit nervous. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AH _ B IH T _ N ER V AH S .
It's the whole season. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ HH OW L _ S IY Z AH N .
It doesn't take much. :: IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ T EY K _ M AH CH .
The hearing was fair. :: DH AH _ HH IY R IH NG _ W AA Z _ F EH R .
I see it as my job. :: AY _ S IY _ IH T _ AE Z _ M AY _ JH AA B .
We can make changes. :: W IY _ K AE N _ M EY K _ CH EY N JH AH Z .
We will win this tie. :: W IY _ W IH L _ W IH N _ DH IH S _ T AY .
I waited and waited. :: AY _ W EY T AH D _ AH N D _ W EY T AH D .
He had a great game. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ G R EY T _ G EY M .
We are not defeated. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ D IH F IY T AH D .
We have to open up. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ OW P AH N _ AH P .
He was all blackened. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AO L _ B L AE K AH N D .
This is the big one. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ B IH G _ W AH N .
That is our main aim. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AW ER _ M EY N _ EY M .
It will come up here. :: IH T _ W IH L _ K AH M _ AH P _ HH IY R .
There are no charges. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ N OW _ CH AA R JH AH Z .
I knew he was dying. :: AY _ N UW _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ D AY IH NG .
I'm sure they love it. :: AY M _ SH UH R _ DH EY _ L AH V _ IH T .
We are proud of them. :: W IY _ AA R _ P R AW D _ AH V _ DH EH M .
I don't think it is. :: AY _ D OW N T _ TH IH NG K _ IH T _ IH Z .
he told a producer. :: HH IY _ T OW L D _ AH _ P R AH D UW S ER .
Lester was like that. :: L EH S T ER _ W AA Z _ L AY K _ DH AE T .
It was my whole life. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ M AY _ HH OW L _ L AY F .
The rest is his own. :: DH AH _ R EH S T _ IH Z _ HH IH Z _ OW N .
It wasn't the issue. :: IH T _ W AA Z AH N T _ DH AH _ IH SH UW .
They want it to work. :: DH EY _ W AA N T _ IH T _ T UW _ W ER K .
I want to be frank. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ B IY _ F R AE NG K .
We are not there yet. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ DH EH R _ Y EH T .
It will not be easy. :: IH T _ W IH L _ N AA T _ B IY _ IY Z IY .
He is pretty upset. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ P R IH T IY _ AH P S EH T .
The call was ignored. :: DH AH _ K AO L _ W AA Z _ IH G N AO R D .
There are two options. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ T UW _ AA P SH AH N Z .
We have a rehearsal. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH _ R IH HH ER S AH L .
I could easy do that. :: AY _ K UH D _ IY Z IY _ D UW _ DH AE T .
This is not the end. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ EH N D .
It just isn't there. :: IH T _ JH AH S T _ IH Z AH N T _ DH EH R .
It is a performance. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ P ER F AO R M AH N S .
I have some comments. :: AY _ HH AE V _ S AH M _ K AA M EH N T S .
We are going nowhere. :: W IY _ AA R _ G OW IH NG _ N OW W EH R .

Lovely day isn't it? :: L AH V L IY _ D EY _ IH Z AH N T _ IH T ?
I think we did well. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ W IY _ D IH D _ W EH L .
Does it really matter? :: D AH Z _ IH T _ R IH L IY _ M AE T ER ?
That is our business. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AW ER _ B IH Z N AH S .
They know no other way. :: DH EY _ N OW _ N OW _ AH DH ER _ W EY .
It was an adventure. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ AE D V EH N CH ER .
They are in the euro. :: DH EY _ AA R _ IH N _ DH AH _ Y UW R OW .
It is set in Paris. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S EH T _ IH N _ P EH R IH S .
He looked very sharp. :: HH IY _ L UH K T _ V EH R IY _ SH AA R P .
They want to see him. :: DH EY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ S IY _ HH IH M .
I drove the ball well. :: AY _ D R OW V _ DH AH _ B AO L _ W EH L .
They're just different. :: DH EH R _ JH AH S T _ D IH F ER AH N T .
It will come all right. :: IH T _ W IH L _ K AH M _ AO L _ R AY T .
We must look forward. :: W IY _ M AH S T _ L UH K _ F AO R W ER D .
It was very formal. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ F AO R M AH L .

We keep an eye on it. :: W IY _ K IY P _ AE N _ AY _ AA N _ IH T .
He is still in shock. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ IH N _ SH AA K .
Dancing was her life. :: D AE N S IH NG _ W AA Z _ HH ER _ L AY F .
Tyson is overwhelmed. :: T AY S AH N _ IH Z _ OW V ER W EH L M D .
And it was this one. :: AH N D _ IH T _ W AA Z _ DH IH S _ W AH N .
That is not the case. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ K EY S .
We are going for it. :: W IY _ AA R _ G OW IH NG _ F AO R _ IH T .
It may well have been. :: IH T _ M EY _ W EH L _ HH AE V _ B IH N .
It should be devolved. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY _ D IH V AA L V D .
She told The Herald. :: SH IY _ T OW L D _ DH AH _ HH EH R AH L D .
Or it would have been. :: AO R _ IH T _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N .
Our people are ready. :: AW ER _ P IY P AH L _ AA R _ R EH D IY .
He gets his moment. :: HH IY _ G EH T S _ HH IH Z _ M OW M AH N T .
The hotel was huge. :: DH AH _ HH OW T EH L _ W AA Z _ HH Y UW JH .
It was an accident. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ AE K S AH D AH N T .
We have achieved that. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH CH IY V D _ DH AE T .
We must do something. :: W IY _ M AH S T _ D UW _ S AH M TH IH NG .
He denied the charge. :: HH IY _ D IH N AY D _ DH AH _ CH AA R JH .
You ask the question. :: Y UW _ AE S K _ DH AH _ K W EH S CH AH N .
I am extremely sad. :: AY _ AE M _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ S AE D .
That would be my view. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ B IY _ M AY _ V Y UW .
It felt right for me. :: IH T _ F EH L T _ R AY T _ F AO R _ M IY .
So, did she meet him? :: S OW , D IH D _ SH IY _ M IY T _ HH IH M ?
We had a grand view. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ G R AE N D _ V Y UW .
It's been a long wait. :: IH T S _ B IH N _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY T .
How can they get one? :: HH AW _ K AE N _ DH EY _ G EH T _ W AH N ?
This is my home town. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ M AY _ HH OW M _ T AW N .
I went with the mood. :: AY _ W EH N T _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ M UW D .
I'm sure that is not. :: AY M _ SH UH R _ DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T .
It's not a great art. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ G R EY T _ AA R T .
Most people know that. :: M OW S T _ P IY P AH L _ N OW _ DH AE T .
How can they say that? :: HH AW _ K AE N _ DH EY _ S EY _ DH AE T ?
Where is the anthrax? :: W EH R _ IH Z _ DH AH _ AE N TH R AE K S ?
I am ready for that. :: AY _ AE M _ R EH D IY _ F AO R _ DH AE T .
Retirement, who knows? :: R IY T AY ER M AH N T , HH UW _ N OW Z ?
You hope he prevails. :: Y UW _ HH OW P _ HH IY _ P R IH V EY L Z .
The answer is mayhem. :: DH AH _ AE N S ER _ IH Z _ M EY HH EH M .
He's a joy to follow. :: HH IY Z _ AH _ JH OY _ T UW _ F AA L OW .
It is simple, really. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S IH M P AH L , R IH L IY .
What are the barriers? :: W AH T _ AA R _ DH AH _ B AE R IY ER Z ?
We shall not do that. :: W IY _ SH AE L _ N AA T _ D UW _ DH AE T .
Stand by for action. :: S T AE N D _ B AY _ F AO R _ AE K SH AH N .
Dewar is the medium. :: D UW ER _ IH Z _ DH AH _ M IY D IY AH M .
It's very ingenious. :: IH T S _ V EH R IY _ IH N JH IY N Y AH S .
The gap is narrowing. :: DH AH _ G AE P _ IH Z _ N EH R OW IH NG .
They are you, the fans. :: DH EY _ AA R _ Y UW , DH AH _ F AE N Z .
Is that not uncanny? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ N AA T _ AH N K AE N IY ?
We won very easily. :: W IY _ W AH N _ V EH R IY _ IY Z AH L IY .
I would recommend it. :: AY _ W UH D _ R EH K AH M EH N D _ IH T .
That has not changed. :: DH AE T _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ CH EY N JH D .
This is not finished. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ F IH N IH SH T .
This is not the case. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ K EY S .
She told me to stop. :: SH IY _ T OW L D _ M IY _ T UW _ S T AA P .
She becomes a mother. :: SH IY _ B IH K AH M Z _ AH _ M AH DH ER .
Where do we spend it? :: W EH R _ D UW _ W IY _ S P EH N D _ IH T ?
This can be extreme. :: DH IH S _ K AE N _ B IY _ IH K S T R IY M .
I can't say anything. :: AY _ K AE N T _ S EY _ EH N IY TH IH NG .
I hope he comes back. :: AY _ HH OW P _ HH IY _ K AH M Z _ B AE K .
That was our mission. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AW ER _ M IH SH AH N .
Sub Not Used, McCall. :: S AH B _ N AA T _ Y UW Z D , M AH K AO L .
What is their concern? :: W AH T _ IH Z _ DH EH R _ K AH N S ER N ?
And you know something? :: AH N D _ Y UW _ N OW _ S AH M TH IH NG ?
Everything is so new. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ IH Z _ S OW _ N UW .
But it would say that. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W UH D _ S EY _ DH AE T .
He knew they were there. :: HH IY _ N UW _ DH EY _ W ER _ DH EH R .
And we are doing it. :: AH N D _ W IY _ AA R _ D UW IH NG _ IH T .
We did not play well. :: W IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ P L EY _ W EH L .
The show is not over. :: DH AH _ SH OW _ IH Z _ N AA T _ OW V ER .
Things are going well. :: TH IH NG Z _ AA R _ G OW IH NG _ W EH L .
I can live with that. :: AY _ K AE N _ L AY V _ W IH DH _ DH AE T .
He has two children. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ CH IH L D R AH N .
So, did she meet him? :: S OW , D IH D _ SH IY _ M IY T _ HH IH M ?
The script was funny. :: DH AH _ S K R IH P T _ W AA Z _ F AH N IY .
I should think so, too. :: AY _ SH UH D _ TH IH NG K _ S OW , T UW .
Our numbers are small. :: AW ER _ N AH M B ER Z _ AA R _ S M AO L .
They could use a boost. :: DH EY _ K UH D _ Y UW S _ AH _ B UW S T .
All options are open. :: AO L _ AA P SH AH N Z _ AA R _ OW P AH N .
Kirkwood was arrested. :: K ER K W UH D _ W AA Z _ ER EH S T AH D .
There is no openness. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ OW P AH N N AH S .
I suspect the latter. :: AY _ S AH S P EH K T _ DH AH _ L AE T ER .
He was a crazy man. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ K R EY Z IY _ M AE N .
We are working on it. :: W IY _ AA R _ W ER K IH NG _ AA N _ IH T .
We want to get there. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ G EH T _ DH EH R .
The game is now open. :: DH AH _ G EY M _ IH Z _ N AW _ OW P AH N .
The idea is simple. :: DH AH _ AY D IY AH _ IH Z _ S IH M P AH L .
And it had two seats. :: AH N D _ IH T _ HH AE D _ T UW _ S IY T S .
Who will pay for this? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ P EY _ F AO R _ DH IH S ?
What will happen then? :: W AH T _ W IH L _ HH AE P AH N _ DH EH N ?
We are a grandmother. :: W IY _ AA R _ AH _ G R AE N D M AH DH ER .
He was on a mission. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AA N _ AH _ M IH SH AH N .
They had no children. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ CH IH L D R AH N .
Action is needed now. :: AE K SH AH N _ IH Z _ N IY D AH D _ N AW .
He scored a touchdown. :: HH IY _ S K AO R D _ AH _ T AH CH D AW N .
Our policy is clear. :: AW ER _ P AA L AH S IY _ IH Z _ K L IH R .
Today was first class. :: T AH D EY _ W AA Z _ F ER S T _ K L AE S .
That remains the same. :: DH AE T _ R IH M EY N Z _ DH AH _ S EY M .
Three hit the target. :: TH R IY _ HH IH T _ DH AH _ T AA R G AH T .
Still, I am delighted. :: S T IH L , AY _ AE M _ D IH L AY T AH D .
It has been declared. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ D IH K L EH R D .
They will be destroyed. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ B IY _ D IH S T R OY D .
It goes with the job. :: IH T _ G OW Z _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ JH AA B .
They have no history. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ N OW _ HH IH S T ER IY .
This remains the case. :: DH IH S _ R IH M EY N Z _ DH AH _ K EY S .
Are you going to win? :: AA R _ Y UW _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ W IH N ?
This makes up for it. :: DH IH S _ M EY K S _ AH P _ F AO R _ IH T .
That comes at a cost. :: DH AE T _ K AH M Z _ AE T _ AH _ K AA S T .
Perhaps they were right. :: P ER HH AE P S _ DH EY _ W ER _ R AY T .
I believe in theatre. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ TH IY AH T ER .
It opened last month. :: IH T _ OW P AH N D _ L AE S T _ M AH N TH .
We would make a start. :: W IY _ W UH D _ M EY K _ AH _ S T AA R T .
I could never be cool. :: AY _ K UH D _ N EH V ER _ B IY _ K UW L .
Choice is a good thing. :: CH OY S _ IH Z _ AH _ G UH D _ TH IH NG .
There's been a mistake. :: DH EH R Z _ B IH N _ AH _ M IH S T EY K .
The children are fine. :: DH AH _ CH IH L D R AH N _ AA R _ F AY N .
Is my wife a racist? :: IH Z _ M AY _ W AY F _ AH _ R EY S IH S T ?
I'm going to miss it. :: AY M _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ M IH S _ IH T .
They would not tell us. :: DH EY _ W UH D _ N AA T _ T EH L _ AH S .
It has been hijacked. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ HH AY JH AE K T .
We got the guarantee. :: W IY _ G AA T _ DH AH _ G EH R AH N T IY .
We've been here before. :: W IY V _ B IH N _ HH IY R _ B IH F AO R .
It was a fiery game. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ F AY ER IY _ G EY M .
Mind you, who wouldn't? :: M AY N D _ Y UW , HH UW _ W UH D AH N T ?
They are not an item. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N AA T _ AE N _ AY T AH M .
This is a great shame. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ SH EY M .
We won't let you down. :: W IY _ W OW N T _ L EH T _ Y UW _ D AW N .
It is patently true. :: IH T _ IH Z _ P AE T AH N T L IY _ T R UW .
It was early morning. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ ER L IY _ M AO R N IH NG .
Or so it would appear. :: AO R _ S OW _ IH T _ W UH D _ AH P IH R .
Which means it matters. :: W IH CH _ M IY N Z _ IH T _ M AE T ER Z .
It all seemed so easy. :: IH T _ AO L _ S IY M D _ S OW _ IY Z IY .
This rule is archaic. :: DH IH S _ R UW L _ IH Z _ AA R K EY IH K .
David was not either. :: D EY V IH D _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ IY DH ER .
It's ahead of Labour. :: IH T S _ AH HH EH D _ AH V _ L EY B AW R .
We'll see what happens. :: W IY L _ S IY _ W AH T _ HH AE P AH N Z .
We haven't been told. :: W IY _ HH AE V AH N T _ B IH N _ T OW L D .
I certainly hope not. :: AY _ S ER T AH N L IY _ HH OW P _ N AA T .
It's the same with us. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ S EY M _ W IH DH _ AH S .
It was worth the wait. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ W ER TH _ DH AH _ W EY T .
It's such a tragedy. :: IH T S _ S AH CH _ AH _ T R AE JH AH D IY .
This is my big break. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ M AY _ B IH G _ B R EY K .
Although, you never know. :: AO L DH OW , Y UW _ N EH V ER _ N OW .
It's not a wish list. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ W IH SH _ L IH S T .
We gave them the goal. :: W IY _ G EY V _ DH EH M _ DH AH _ G OW L .
That's a huge amount. :: DH AE T S _ AH _ HH Y UW JH _ AH M AW N T .
It could be a danger. :: IH T _ K UH D _ B IY _ AH _ D EY N JH ER .
I'll just do my best. :: AY L _ JH AH S T _ D UW _ M AY _ B EH S T .
The message was clear. :: DH AH _ M EH S AH JH _ W AA Z _ K L IH R .
He doesn't do dinner. :: HH IY _ D AH Z AH N T _ D UW _ D IH N ER .
Then  all was revealed. :: DH EH N _ AO L _ W AA Z _ R IH V IY L D .
We should just say no. :: W IY _ SH UH D _ JH AH S T _ S EY _ N OW .
That is a brand name. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AH _ B R AE N D _ N EY M .
The crowd was waiting. :: DH AH _ K R AW D _ W AA Z _ W EY T IH NG .
How will we get there? :: HH AW _ W IH L _ W IY _ G EH T _ DH EH R ?
There is no other way. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ AH DH ER _ W EY .
But it did not last. :: B AH T _ IH T _ D IH D _ N AA T _ L AE S T .
No-one can take it in. :: _ N UW N _ K AE N _ T EY K _ IH T _ IH N .
Just get on with it. :: JH AH S T _ G EH T _ AA N _ W IH DH _ IH T .
I didn't play badly. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ P L EY _ B AE D L IY .
Couldn't see the point. :: K UH D AH N T _ S IY _ DH AH _ P OY N T .
Yet it seemed to work. :: Y EH T _ IH T _ S IY M D _ T UW _ W ER K .
But it is historic. :: B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ HH IH S T AO R IH K .
Will they fall in love? :: W IH L _ DH EY _ F AO L _ IH N _ L AH V ?
Let's make him a show. :: L EH T S _ M EY K _ HH IH M _ AH _ SH OW .
It is a good result. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ G UH D _ R IH Z AH L T .
It doesn't make sense. :: IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ M EY K _ S EH N S .
I'll go to the races. :: AY L _ G OW _ T UW _ DH AH _ R EY S AH Z .
It's the whole package. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ HH OW L _ P AE K AH JH .
It is my last chance. :: IH T _ IH Z _ M AY _ L AE S T _ CH AE N S .
That will be the case. :: DH AE T _ W IH L _ B IY _ DH AH _ K EY S .
We can build on that. :: W IY _ K AE N _ B IH L D _ AA N _ DH AE T .
This isn't a gimmick. :: DH IH S _ IH Z AH N T _ AH _ G IH M IH K .
I will be ridiculed. :: AY _ W IH L _ B IY _ R IH D AH K Y UW L D .
It is not an escape. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AE N _ IH S K EY P .
But this is nonsense. :: B AH T _ DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA N S EH N S .
Where did that finish? :: W EH R _ D IH D _ DH AE T _ F IH N IH SH ?
It is the best place. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ B EH S T _ P L EY S .
No reason was given. :: N OW _ R IY Z AH N _ W AA Z _ G IH V AH N .
We got on very well. :: W IY _ G AA T _ AA N _ V EH R IY _ W EH L .
I'm a bit overwhelmed. :: AY M _ AH _ B IH T _ OW V ER W EH L M D .
It's a matter of time. :: IH T S _ AH _ M AE T ER _ AH V _ T AY M .
It will never happen. :: IH T _ W IH L _ N EH V ER _ HH AE P AH N .
That's as it should be. :: DH AE T S _ AE Z _ IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY .
You are a great player. :: Y UW _ AA R _ AH _ G R EY T _ P L EY ER .
Oil embargo endorsed. :: OY L _ EH M B AA R G OW _ EH N D AO R S T .
He's very explosive. :: HH IY Z _ V EH R IY _ IH K S P L OW S IH V .
We will look into it. :: W IY _ W IH L _ L UH K _ IH N T UW _ IH T .
I told you I was ill. :: AY _ T OW L D _ Y UW _ AY _ W AA Z _ IH L .
I have got a victim. :: AY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ AH _ V IH K T AH M .
They're appalled by that. :: DH EH R _ AH P AO L D _ B AY _ DH AE T .
Who will pay for this? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ P EY _ F AO R _ DH IH S ?
She was well balanced. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ W EH L _ B AE L AH N S T .
The train was on time. :: DH AH _ T R EY N _ W AA Z _ AA N _ T AY M .
And we have a singer. :: AH N D _ W IY _ HH AE V _ AH _ S IH NG ER .
What will happen then? :: W AH T _ W IH L _ HH AE P AH N _ DH EH N ?
It is the old story. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ OW L D _ S T AO R IY .
I'd just like to play. :: AY D _ JH AH S T _ L AY K _ T UW _ P L EY .
It's not a quick fix. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ K W IH K _ F IH K S .
We live on an island. :: W IY _ L AY V _ AA N _ AE N _ AY L AH N D .
But we are very near. :: B AH T _ W IY _ AA R _ V EH R IY _ N IH R .
I saw some good things. :: AY _ S AO _ S AH M _ G UH D _ TH IH NG Z .
We shall not be moved. :: W IY _ SH AE L _ N AA T _ B IY _ M UW V D .
She is not a victim. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ V IH K T AH M .
Says the Duke of York. :: S EH Z _ DH AH _ D UW K _ AH V _ Y AO R K .
We had to add value. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ AE D _ V AE L Y UW .
We can't get over it. :: W IY _ K AE N T _ G EH T _ OW V ER _ IH T .
He was a lovely man. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ L AH V L IY _ M AE N .
The plot is minimal. :: DH AH _ P L AA T _ IH Z _ M IH N AH M AH L .
We work well together. :: W IY _ W ER K _ W EH L _ T AH G EH DH ER .
It's too close to call. :: IH T S _ T UW _ K L OW S _ T UW _ K AO L .
It was too difficult. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ D IH F AH K AH L T .
I am the Son of Sam. :: AY _ AE M _ DH AH _ S AH N _ AH V _ S AE M .
No preference emerged. :: N OW _ P R EH F ER AH N S _ IH M ER JH D .
It would be quite nice. :: IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ K W AY T _ N AY S .
Check that he is dead. :: CH EH K _ DH AE T _ HH IY _ IH Z _ D EH D .
The idea is not new. :: DH AH _ AY D IY AH _ IH Z _ N AA T _ N UW .
She has a little boy. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ AH _ L IH T AH L _ B OY .
I saw it didn't work. :: AY _ S AO _ IH T _ D IH D AH N T _ W ER K .
I saw people on fire. :: AY _ S AO _ P IY P AH L _ AA N _ F AY ER .
I go home only once. :: AY _ G OW _ HH OW M _ OW N L IY _ W AH N S .
O Neill has delivered. :: OW _ N IY L _ HH AE Z _ D IH L IH V ER D .
It's like a car crash. :: IH T S _ L AY K _ AH _ K AA R _ K R AE SH .
I will not be afraid. :: AY _ W IH L _ N AA T _ B IY _ AH F R EY D .
That's the way it goes. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ W EY _ IH T _ G OW Z .
The might be rolled out. :: DH AH _ M AY T _ B IY _ R OW L D _ AW T .
We are having a look. :: W IY _ AA R _ HH AE V IH NG _ AH _ L UH K .
They believed it worked. :: DH EY _ B IH L IY V D _ IH T _ W ER K T .
It is quite a figure. :: IH T _ IH Z _ K W AY T _ AH _ F IH G Y ER .
I'll tell you honestly. :: AY L _ T EH L _ Y UW _ AA N AH S T L IY .
Sometimes they come off. :: S AH M T AY M Z _ DH EY _ K AH M _ AO F .
You do have a way out. :: Y UW _ D UW _ HH AE V _ AH _ W EY _ AW T .
I've been very nervous. :: AY V _ B IH N _ V EH R IY _ N ER V AH S .
I just could not cope. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ K UH D _ N AA T _ K OW P .
We told them in June. :: W IY _ T OW L D _ DH EH M _ IH N _ JH UW N .
The feeling is awesome. :: DH AH _ F IY L IH NG _ IH Z _ AA S AH M .
They are not suitable. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N AA T _ S UW T AH B AH L .
Then he did it twice. :: DH EH N _ HH IY _ D IH D _ IH T _ T W AY S .
I read it every year. :: AY _ R EH D _ IH T _ EH V ER IY _ Y IH R .
There is no guarantee. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ G EH R AH N T IY .
I made a big mistake. :: AY _ M EY D _ AH _ B IH G _ M IH S T EY K .
Don't hold your breath. :: D OW N T _ HH OW L D _ Y AO R _ B R EH TH .
That was the problem. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
Are you in this movie? :: AA R _ Y UW _ IH N _ DH IH S _ M UW V IY ?
We do need a new one. :: W IY _ D UW _ N IY D _ AH _ N UW _ W AH N .
Debbie Harry was cool. :: D EH B IY _ HH EH R IY _ W AA Z _ K UW L .
It's like the Russians. :: IH T S _ L AY K _ DH AH _ R AH SH AH N Z .
No other offers apply. :: N OW _ AH DH ER _ AO F ER Z _ AH P L AY .
We've turned the corner. :: W IY V _ T ER N D _ DH AH _ K AO R N ER .
We started with that. :: W IY _ S T AA R T AH D _ W IH DH _ DH AE T .
They got the job done. :: DH EY _ G AA T _ DH AH _ JH AA B _ D AH N .
This has been a shock. :: DH IH S _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ AH _ SH AA K .
I am not in denial. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ IH N _ D IH N AY AH L .
We have some concerns. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ S AH M _ K AH N S ER N Z .
It's so much more fun. :: IH T S _ S OW _ M AH CH _ M AO R _ F AH N .
I cannot say anymore. :: AY _ K AE N AA T _ S EY _ EH N IY M AO R .
Trevor has been great. :: T R EH V ER _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ G R EY T .
There's also the point. :: DH EH R Z _ AO L S OW _ DH AH _ P OY N T .
I am ashamed of them. :: AY _ AE M _ AH SH EY M D _ AH V _ DH EH M .
They must not succeed. :: DH EY _ M AH S T _ N AA T _ S AH K S IY D .
Let's get to know him. :: L EH T S _ G EH T _ T UW _ N OW _ HH IH M .
That's the whole idea. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ HH OW L _ AY D IY AH .
That is not bigotry. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ B IH G AH T R IY .
It does not take much. :: IH T _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ T EY K _ M AH CH .
We just love to chat. :: W IY _ JH AH S T _ L AH V _ T UW _ CH AE T .
This is my new career. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ M AY _ N UW _ K ER IH R .
We could feel the heat. :: W IY _ K UH D _ F IY L _ DH AH _ HH IY T .
Where is the structure? :: W EH R _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S T R AH K CH ER ?
Don't hold your breath! :: D OW N T _ HH OW L D _ Y AO R _ B R EH TH !
All of them were killed. :: AO L _ AH V _ DH EH M _ W ER _ K IH L D .
We have great support. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G R EY T _ S AH P AO R T .
They know the language. :: DH EY _ N OW _ DH AH _ L AE NG G W AH JH .
I was very surprised. :: AY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ S ER P R AY Z D .
The number never came. :: DH AH _ N AH M B ER _ N EH V ER _ K EY M .
I cannot describe it. :: AY _ K AE N AA T _ D IH S K R AY B _ IH T .
We await a decision. :: W IY _ AH W EY T _ AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N .
Yes, we can beat them. :: Y EH S , W IY _ K AE N _ B IY T _ DH EH M .
It is a real concern. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ R IY L _ K AH N S ER N .
There is no formula. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ F AO R M Y AH L AH .
It's a gigantic con. :: IH T S _ AH _ JH AY G AE N T IH K _ K AA N .
We live in shorthand. :: W IY _ L AY V _ IH N _ SH AO R T HH AE N D .
The plane was shaking. :: DH AH _ P L EY N _ W AA Z _ SH EY K IH NG .
That's the way they are. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ W EY _ DH EY _ AA R .
They are already there. :: DH EY _ AA R _ AO L R EH D IY _ DH EH R .
It is our other home. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AW ER _ AH DH ER _ HH OW M .
If only it had been. :: IH F _ OW N L IY _ IH T _ HH AE D _ B IH N .
It's going to happen. :: IH T S _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ HH AE P AH N .
I think she was right. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ SH IY _ W AA Z _ R AY T .
It's on with a roller. :: IH T S _ AA N _ W IH DH _ AH _ R OW L ER .
I sit at home a lot. :: AY _ S IH T _ AE T _ HH OW M _ AH _ L AA T .
Where is the evidence? :: W EH R _ IH Z _ DH AH _ EH V AH D AH N S ?
He deserved that much. :: HH IY _ D IH Z ER V D _ DH AE T _ M AH CH .
This could be the case. :: DH IH S _ K UH D _ B IY _ DH AH _ K EY S .
It was just one man. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ W AH N _ M AE N .
Not so, he insisted. :: N AA T _ S OW , HH IY _ IH N S IH S T AH D .
I've already got this. :: AY V _ AO L R EH D IY _ G AA T _ DH IH S .
You'd better believe it. :: Y UW D _ B EH T ER _ B IH L IY V _ IH T .
It could take some time. :: IH T _ K UH D _ T EY K _ S AH M _ T AY M .
That might help a bit. :: DH AE T _ M AY T _ HH EH L P _ AH _ B IH T .
He was asked to quit. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AE S K T _ T UW _ K W IH T .
It is a sign of hope. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ S AY N _ AH V _ HH OW P .
But it might have done. :: B AH T _ IH T _ M AY T _ HH AE V _ D AH N .
It's the big omission. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ B IH G _ OW M IH SH AH N .
He had been a singer. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ AH _ S IH NG ER .
The fight is under way. :: DH AH _ F AY T _ IH Z _ AH N D ER _ W EY .
Size is not the issue. :: S AY Z _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ IH SH UW .
I had my suspicions. :: AY _ HH AE D _ M AY _ S AH S P IH SH AH N Z .
There is no signature. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ S IH G N AH CH ER .
My mother is a widow. :: M AY _ M AH DH ER _ IH Z _ AH _ W IH D OW .
He can do everything. :: HH IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ EH V R IY TH IH NG .
That is highly unfair. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ HH AY L IY _ AH N F EH R .
This is a true story. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ T R UW _ S T AO R IY .
Tomorrow is a new day. :: T AH M AA R OW _ IH Z _ AH _ N UW _ D EY .
I was ready for this. :: AY _ W AA Z _ R EH D IY _ F AO R _ DH IH S .
It's going to be fun. :: IH T S _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ B IY _ F AH N .
It is a large number. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ L AA R JH _ N AH M B ER .
That would be too easy. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ B IY _ T UW _ IY Z IY .
We were given a break. :: W IY _ W ER _ G IH V AH N _ AH _ B R EY K .
He has seen the past. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ S IY N _ DH AH _ P AE S T .
Feel the air, the space. :: F IY L _ DH AH _ EH R , DH AH _ S P EY S .
I had relied on him. :: AY _ HH AE D _ R IH L AY D _ AA N _ HH IH M .
The mood was defiant. :: DH AH _ M UW D _ W AA Z _ D IH F AY AH N T .
It is not so simple. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ S OW _ S IH M P AH L .
We can take the city. :: W IY _ K AE N _ T EY K _ DH AH _ S IH T IY .
They could not match it. :: DH EY _ K UH D _ N AA T _ M AE CH _ IH T .
That is the real test. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ R IY L _ T EH S T .
It is somewhere to be. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S AH M W EH R _ T UW _ B IY .
The fans would love it. :: DH AH _ F AE N Z _ W UH D _ L AH V _ IH T .
It was a good workout. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G UH D _ W ER K AW T .
Or so the theory goes. :: AO R _ S OW _ DH AH _ TH IH R IY _ G OW Z .
It starts at the top. :: IH T _ S T AA R T S _ AE T _ DH AH _ T AA P .
But I've won both ways. :: B AH T _ AY V _ W AH N _ B OW TH _ W EY Z .
It came as a surprise. :: IH T _ K EY M _ AE Z _ AH _ S ER P R AY Z .
It's a crucial award. :: IH T S _ AH _ K R UW SH AH L _ AH W AO R D .
You could feel the heat. :: Y UW _ K UH D _ F IY L _ DH AH _ HH IY T .
That is not possible. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ P AA S AH B AH L .
Sport is good for you. :: S P AO R T _ IH Z _ G UH D _ F AO R _ Y UW .
Murray plays down return :: M ER IY _ P L EY Z _ D AW N _ R IH T ER N
Then another one came. :: DH EH N _ AH N AH DH ER _ W AH N _ K EY M .
It is normal for me. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AO R M AH L _ F AO R _ M IY .
So was the first half. :: S OW _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ F ER S T _ HH AE F .
So what happens next? :: S OW _ W AH T _ HH AE P AH N Z _ N EH K S T ?
It's not a small step. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ S M AO L _ S T EH P .
Williams said the same. :: W IH L Y AH M Z _ S EH D _ DH AH _ S EY M .
We've got good options. :: W IY V _ G AA T _ G UH D _ AA P SH AH N Z .
The task is enormous. :: DH AH _ T AE S K _ IH Z _ IH N AO R M AH S .
It's not an easy life. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AE N _ IY Z IY _ L AY F .
Or so the story goes. :: AO R _ S OW _ DH AH _ S T AO R IY _ G OW Z .
It was quite rigorous. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K W AY T _ R IH G ER AH S .
It seemed so personal. :: IH T _ S IY M D _ S OW _ P ER S IH N IH L .
I carried on for him. :: AY _ K AE R IY D _ AA N _ F AO R _ HH IH M .
They might well be right. :: DH EY _ M AY T _ W EH L _ B IY _ R AY T .
Subs not used, McGraw. :: S AH B Z _ N AA T _ Y UW Z D , M AH G R AO .
I'm not a little girl. :: AY M _ N AA T _ AH _ L IH T AH L _ G ER L .
I sincerely hope not. :: AY _ S IH N S IH R L IY _ HH OW P _ N AA T .
The cold war is over. :: DH AH _ K OW L D _ W AO R _ IH Z _ OW V ER .
And he had much need. :: AH N D _ HH IY _ HH AE D _ M AH CH _ N IY D .
But there was a shift. :: B AH T _ DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ SH IH F T .
No person was charged. :: N OW _ P ER S AH N _ W AA Z _ CH AA R JH D .
Harold is a rarity. :: HH EH R AH L D _ IH Z _ AH _ R EH R AH T IY .
They have two children. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ CH IH L D R AH N .
How can we ignore it? :: HH AW _ K AE N _ W IY _ IH G N AO R _ IH T ?
He is a joy to watch. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ JH OY _ T UW _ W AA CH .
We need to tighten up. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ T AY T AH N _ AH P .
I lost a part of me. :: AY _ L AO S T _ AH _ P AA R T _ AH V _ M IY .
They were not defeated. :: DH EY _ W ER _ N AA T _ D IH F IY T AH D .
It's a difficult job. :: IH T S _ AH _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ JH AA B .
He will do very well. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ D UW _ V EH R IY _ W EH L .
They haven't run away. :: DH EY _ HH AE V AH N T _ R AH N _ AH W EY .
Of course he was right! :: AH V _ K AO R S _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ R AY T !
We are not moving in. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ M UW V IH NG _ IH N .
The stadium was full. :: DH AH _ S T EY D IY AH M _ W AA Z _ F UH L .
They should feel ashamed. :: DH EY _ SH UH D _ F IY L _ AH SH EY M D .
Feel for five seconds. :: F IY L _ F AO R _ F AY V _ S EH K AH N D Z .
Do you know who we are? :: D UW _ Y UW _ N OW _ HH UW _ W IY _ AA R ?
Our home is your home. :: AW ER _ HH OW M _ IH Z _ Y AO R _ HH OW M .
But it wasn't to be. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z AH N T _ T UW _ B IY .
Was this a new event? :: W AA Z _ DH IH S _ AH _ N UW _ IH V EH N T ?
He did, and he missed. :: HH IY _ D IH D , AH N D _ HH IY _ M IH S T .
He's on the wrong side. :: HH IY Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ R AO NG _ S AY D .
I didn't have a clue. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ HH AE V _ AH _ K L UW .
If only we had known. :: IH F _ OW N L IY _ W IY _ HH AE D _ N OW N .
That is as it may be. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AE Z _ IH T _ M EY _ B IY .
It is extremely sad. :: IH T _ IH Z _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ S AE D .
It feels like too much. :: IH T _ F IY L Z _ L AY K _ T UW _ M AH CH .
We couldn't afford it. :: W IY _ K UH D AH N T _ AH F AO R D _ IH T .
Cloning is not ready. :: K L OW N IH NG _ IH Z _ N AA T _ R EH D IY .
There was no secrecy. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ S IY K R AH S IY .
Sprinters are not fit. :: S P R IH N T ER Z _ AA R _ N AA T _ F IH T .
He was right of course. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ R AY T _ AH V _ K AO R S .
I've already done that. :: AY V _ AO L R EH D IY _ D AH N _ DH AE T .
No one was listening. :: N OW _ W AH N _ W AA Z _ L IH S AH N IH NG .
And they are different. :: AH N D _ DH EY _ AA R _ D IH F ER AH N T .
Because it's a secret. :: B IH K AO Z _ IH T S _ AH _ S IY K R AH T .
Directing, if you like. :: D ER EH K T IH NG , IH F _ Y UW _ L AY K .
But who is the killer? :: B AH T _ HH UW _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K IH L ER ?
I was a local hero. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AH _ L OW K AH L _ HH IH R OW .
We have no excuses. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ N OW _ IH K S K Y UW S IH Z .
But is that possible? :: B AH T _ IH Z _ DH AE T _ P AA S AH B AH L ?
It's not a new device. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ N UW _ D IH V AY S .
I don't take that view. :: AY _ D OW N T _ T EY K _ DH AE T _ V Y UW .
There are two problems. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ T UW _ P R AA B L AH M Z .
But this was refused. :: B AH T _ DH IH S _ W AA Z _ R AH F Y UW Z D .
There's always a chance. :: DH EH R Z _ AO L W EY Z _ AH _ CH AE N S .
The incident is dead. :: DH AH _ IH N S AH D AH N T _ IH Z _ D EH D .
He died in September. :: HH IY _ D AY D _ IH N _ S EH P T EH M B ER .
Paterson was the man. :: P AE T ER S AH N _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ M AE N .
I have made that offer. :: AY _ HH AE V _ M EY D _ DH AE T _ AO F ER .
It looked like a river. :: IH T _ L UH K T _ L AY K _ AH _ R IH V ER .
Look at the witnesses. :: L UH K _ AE T _ DH AH _ W IH T N AH S AH Z .
I kept going for her. :: AY _ K EH P T _ G OW IH NG _ F AO R _ HH ER .
We will pay their bills. :: W IY _ W IH L _ P EY _ DH EH R _ B IH L Z .
This is a holy place. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ HH OW L IY _ P L EY S .
There is no quick fix. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ K W IH K _ F IH K S .
So what happens next? :: S OW _ W AH T _ HH AE P AH N Z _ N EH K S T ?
We have other options. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH DH ER _ AA P SH AH N Z .
They are not left wing. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N AA T _ L EH F T _ W IH NG .
It is a road of death. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ R OW D _ AH V _ D EH TH .
You're a gambling man. :: Y UH R _ AH _ G AE M B AH L IH NG _ M AE N .
It is really good news. :: IH T _ IH Z _ R IH L IY _ G UH D _ N UW Z .
She is in their hands. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ IH N _ DH EH R _ HH AE N D Z .
Everyone can be bought. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ K AE N _ B IY _ B AA T .
We never played at all. :: W IY _ N EH V ER _ P L EY D _ AE T _ AO L .
These days will be back. :: DH IY Z _ D EY Z _ W IH L _ B IY _ B AE K .
But it was a pleasure. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ P L EH ZH ER .
They should come forward. :: DH EY _ SH UH D _ K AH M _ F AO R W ER D .
He is a right bastard. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ R AY T _ B AE S T ER D .
Golf is not like that. :: G AA L F _ IH Z _ N AA T _ L AY K _ DH AE T .
They had a confession. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ AH _ K AH N F EH SH AH N .
That is still the case. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ DH AH _ K EY S .
The State would provide. :: DH AH _ S T EY T _ W UH D _ P R AH V AY D .
IT S all in the hair. :: IH T _ EH S _ AO L _ IH N _ DH AH _ HH EH R .
We beat the Welsh team. :: W IY _ B IY T _ DH AH _ W EH L CH _ T IY M .
I am never fully fit. :: AY _ AE M _ N EH V ER _ F UH L IY _ F IH T .
It's clearly a budget. :: IH T S _ K L IH R L IY _ AH _ B AH JH IH T .
I managed to do that. :: AY _ M AE N AH JH D _ T UW _ D UW _ DH AE T .
What would be the point? :: W AH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ DH AH _ P OY N T ?
They tried to deny it. :: DH EY _ T R AY D _ T UW _ D IH N AY _ IH T .
He was the architect. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ AA R K AH T EH K T .
It does not stop here. :: IH T _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ S T AA P _ HH IY R .
Do I have a favourite? :: D UW _ AY _ HH AE V _ AH _ F EY V ER IH T ?
You could very well be. :: Y UW _ K UH D _ V EH R IY _ W EH L _ B IY .
But I am in practice. :: B AH T _ AY _ AE M _ IH N _ P R AE K T AH S .
I believe they are dead. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ DH EY _ AA R _ D EH D .
Who was on the panel? :: HH UW _ W AA Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ P AE N AH L ?
That idea is rubbish. :: DH AE T _ AY D IY AH _ IH Z _ R AH B IH SH .
It is a real problem. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ R IY L _ P R AA B L AH M .
He said he was sorry. :: HH IY _ S EH D _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ S AA R IY .
It was like a vacuum. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ L AY K _ AH _ V AE K Y UW M .
His game was complete. :: HH IH Z _ G EY M _ W AA Z _ K AH M P L IY T .
The Cup has come home. :: DH AH _ K AH P _ HH AE Z _ K AH M _ HH OW M .
This was not helpful. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ HH EH L P F AH L .
It's time for a change. :: IH T S _ T AY M _ F AO R _ AH _ CH EY N JH .
It's part of your life. :: IH T S _ P AA R T _ AH V _ Y AO R _ L AY F .
Michael, he is running! :: M AY K AH L , HH IY _ IH Z _ R AH N IH NG !
I can't speak for him. :: AY _ K AE N T _ S P IY K _ F AO R _ HH IH M .
Gas is too expensive. :: G AE S _ IH Z _ T UW _ IH K S P EH N S IH V .
It didn't put me off. :: IH T _ D IH D AH N T _ P UH T _ M IY _ AO F .
I wanted to drop out. :: AY _ W AA N T AH D _ T UW _ D R AA P _ AW T .
The mood was euphoric. :: DH AH _ M UW D _ W AA Z _ Y UW F AO R IH K .
There is no such thing. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ S AH CH _ TH IH NG .
Will they ever reopen? :: W IH L _ DH EY _ EH V ER _ R IY OW P AH N ?
We are being hijacked. :: W IY _ AA R _ B IY IH NG _ HH AY JH AE K T .
You can see their point. :: Y UW _ K AE N _ S IY _ DH EH R _ P OY N T .
It's not in my nature. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ IH N _ M AY _ N EY CH ER .
It's all too short term. :: IH T S _ AO L _ T UW _ SH AO R T _ T ER M .
You were the kidnappers. :: Y UW _ W ER _ DH AH _ K IH D N AE P ER Z .
Do yourselves a favour. :: D UW _ Y UH R S EH L V Z _ AH _ F EY V ER .
You have to think not. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ TH IH NG K _ N AA T .
Ownership was the game. :: OW N ER SH IH P _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ G EY M .
We stopped at half-time. :: W IY _ S T AA P T _ AE T _ HH AE F T AY M .
They've been here before. :: DH EY V _ B IH N _ HH IY R _ B IH F AO R .
We don't ask for much. :: W IY _ D OW N T _ AE S K _ F AO R _ M AH CH .
I could not believe it. :: AY _ K UH D _ N AA T _ B IH L IY V _ IH T .
However, we came through. :: HH AW EH V ER , W IY _ K EY M _ TH R UW .
We have it on video. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ IH T _ AA N _ V IH D IY OW .
So, why does he do it? :: S OW , W AY _ D AH Z _ HH IY _ D UW _ IH T ?
We have got to attack. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ T UW _ AH T AE K .
That is my preference. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ M AY _ P R EH F ER AH N S .
Now it is much easier. :: N AW _ IH T _ IH Z _ M AH CH _ IY Z IY ER .
What she will do next? :: W AH T _ SH IY _ W IH L _ D UW _ N EH K S T ?
I was backing him up. :: AY _ W AA Z _ B AE K IH NG _ HH IH M _ AH P .
They might want to play. :: DH EY _ M AY T _ W AA N T _ T UW _ P L EY .
It has to be funded. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ B IY _ F AH N D AH D .
They'll have to pay more. :: DH EY L _ HH AE V _ T UW _ P EY _ M AO R .
It is deeply worrying. :: IH T _ IH Z _ D IY P L IY _ W ER IY IH NG .
I needed to get away. :: AY _ N IY D AH D _ T UW _ G EH T _ AH W EY .
We have been so lucky. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ S OW _ L AH K IY .
There are two mysteries. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ T UW _ M IH S T ER IY Z .
I think it has worked. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T _ HH AE Z _ W ER K T .
That was a fairy tale. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH _ F EH R IY _ T EY L .
We have expected it. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ IH K S P EH K T AH D _ IH T .
She was so supportive. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ S OW _ S AH P AO R T IH V .
That was a month ago. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH _ M AH N TH _ AH G OW .
We are not collecting. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ K AH L EH K T IH NG .
This is the crossroads. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K R AO S R OW D Z .
This has got to stop. :: DH IH S _ HH AE Z _ G AA T _ T UW _ S T AA P .
He would have loved it. :: HH IY _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ L AH V D _ IH T .
But this is different. :: B AH T _ DH IH S _ IH Z _ D IH F ER AH N T .
Things are meant to be. :: TH IH NG Z _ AA R _ M EH N T _ T UW _ B IY .
Six years is too long. :: S IH K S _ Y IH R Z _ IH Z _ T UW _ L AO NG .
There is good quality. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ G UH D _ K W AA L AH T IY .
It can be frightening. :: IH T _ K AE N _ B IY _ F R AY T AH N IH NG .
But we are confident. :: B AH T _ W IY _ AA R _ K AA N F AH D AH N T .
So what's it all about? :: S OW _ W AH T S _ IH T _ AO L _ AH B AW T ?
It meant a lot to us. :: IH T _ M EH N T _ AH _ L AA T _ T UW _ AH S .
That is the difference. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ D IH F ER AH N S .
They need to be helped. :: DH EY _ N IY D _ T UW _ B IY _ HH EH L P T .
That was my last game. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ M AY _ L AE S T _ G EY M .
Let the voters decide. :: L EH T _ DH AH _ V OW T ER Z _ D IH S AY D .
It's about New Yorkers. :: IH T S _ AH B AW T _ N UW _ Y AO R K ER Z .
We go back a long way. :: W IY _ G OW _ B AE K _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY .
Do we want to see it? :: D UW _ W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ S IY _ IH T ?
It was crucial strike. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K R UW SH AH L _ S T R AY K .
We have nowhere to go. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ N OW W EH R _ T UW _ G OW .
You can't take a chance. :: Y UW _ K AE N T _ T EY K _ AH _ CH AE N S .
Is that not pathetic? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ N AA T _ P AH TH EH T IH K ?
They went to the press. :: DH EY _ W EH N T _ T UW _ DH AH _ P R EH S .
Does a lot of drawing. :: D AH Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ D R AO IH NG .
Do I have a favourite? :: D UW _ AY _ HH AE V _ AH _ F EY V ER IH T ?
The squad is too small. :: DH AH _ S K W AA D _ IH Z _ T UW _ S M AO L .
He will go a long way. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ G OW _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY .
Boy is the town a mess. :: B OY _ IH Z _ DH AH _ T AW N _ AH _ M EH S .
He has not been named. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ B IH N _ N EY M D .
The warning is timely. :: DH AH _ W AO R N IH NG _ IH Z _ T AY M L IY .
The jury is still out. :: DH AH _ JH UH R IY _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ AW T .
The force is with them. :: DH AH _ F AO R S _ IH Z _ W IH DH _ DH EH M .
We have the easy part. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ IY Z IY _ P AA R T .
I do not like to lose. :: AY _ D UW _ N AA T _ L AY K _ T UW _ L UW Z .
Everyone was in tears. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ W AA Z _ IH N _ T EH R Z .
Who was on the panel? :: HH UW _ W AA Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ P AE N AH L ?
This year I understood. :: DH IH S _ Y IH R _ AY _ AH N D ER S T UH D .
It's so hard to shift. :: IH T S _ S OW _ HH AA R D _ T UW _ SH IH F T .
It was a piece of art. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ P IY S _ AH V _ AA R T .
I suggest a new plan. :: AY _ S AH G JH EH S T _ AH _ N UW _ P L AE N .
A review is under way. :: AH _ R IY V Y UW _ IH Z _ AH N D ER _ W EY .
They should be so lucky. :: DH EY _ SH UH D _ B IY _ S OW _ L AH K IY .
I had a bit in hand. :: AY _ HH AE D _ AH _ B IH T _ IH N _ HH AE N D .
Who would be a referee? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ B IY _ AH _ R EH F ER IY ?
We need to handle it. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ HH AE N D AH L _ IH T .
We run within the law. :: W IY _ R AH N _ W IH DH IH N _ DH AH _ L AO .
I've got my own ideas. :: AY V _ G AA T _ M AY _ OW N _ AY D IY AH Z .
I am so proud of him. :: AY _ AE M _ S OW _ P R AW D _ AH V _ HH IH M .
I must make that clear. :: AY _ M AH S T _ M EY K _ DH AE T _ K L IH R .
THE force is with them. :: DH AH _ F AO R S _ IH Z _ W IH DH _ DH EH M .
That would be unlawful. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ B IY _ AH N L AO F AH L .
The weaknesses are few. :: DH AH _ W IY K N AH S AH Z _ AA R _ F Y UW .
Rugby is a hard game. :: R AH G B IY _ IH Z _ AH _ HH AA R D _ G EY M .
Kenny and I are ready. :: K EH N IY _ AH N D _ AY _ AA R _ R EH D IY .
It is pretty bad news. :: IH T _ IH Z _ P R IH T IY _ B AE D _ N UW Z .
The show is at an end. :: DH AH _ SH OW _ IH Z _ AE T _ AE N _ EH N D .
It is good for Europe. :: IH T _ IH Z _ G UH D _ F AO R _ Y UH R AH P .
That's the way it works. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ W EY _ IH T _ W ER K S .
They have to come clean. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ K AH M _ K L IY N .
The truth will come out. :: DH AH _ T R UW TH _ W IH L _ K AH M _ AW T .
It gives a commitment. :: IH T _ G IH V Z _ AH _ K AH M IH T M AH N T .
Now we have fresh hope. :: N AW _ W IY _ HH AE V _ F R EH SH _ HH OW P .
After the match, do you? :: AE F T ER _ DH AH _ M AE CH , D UW _ Y UW ?
The view is impressive. :: DH AH _ V Y UW _ IH Z _ IH M P R EH S IH V .
But it is her picture. :: B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ HH ER _ P IH K CH ER .
It had been accepted. :: IH T _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ AE K S EH P T IH D .
I can give no comment. :: AY _ K AE N _ G IH V _ N OW _ K AA M EH N T .
I am not very pleased. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ V EH R IY _ P L IY Z D .
That is still in place. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ IH N _ P L EY S .
My players are special. :: M AY _ P L EY ER Z _ AA R _ S P EH SH AH L .
The plane was in flames :: DH AH _ P L EY N _ W AA Z _ IH N _ F L EY M Z
It won't be their last. :: IH T _ W OW N T _ B IY _ DH EH R _ L AE S T .
It ignores the future. :: IH T _ IH G N AO R Z _ DH AH _ F Y UW CH ER .
It is typical of me. :: IH T _ IH Z _ T IH P AH K AH L _ AH V _ M IY .
This was no accident. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ N OW _ AE K S AH D AH N T .
It's annoying in a way. :: IH T S _ AH N OY IH NG _ IH N _ AH _ W EY .
It just would not work. :: IH T _ JH AH S T _ W UH D _ N AA T _ W ER K .
The driver was unhurt. :: DH AH _ D R AY V ER _ W AA Z _ AH N HH ER T .
Not so, it transpires. :: N AA T _ S OW , IH T _ T R AE N S P AY ER Z .
That is European law. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ Y UH R AH P IY AH N _ L AO .
I am writing a novel. :: AY _ AE M _ R AY T IH NG _ AH _ N AA V AH L .
This is our Olympics. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AW ER _ OW L IH M P IH K S .
I don't understand it. :: AY _ D OW N T _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ IH T .
We will see how he is. :: W IY _ W IH L _ S IY _ HH AW _ HH IY _ IH Z .
There was even a joke. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ IY V IH N _ AH _ JH OW K .
But we still don't know. :: B AH T _ W IY _ S T IH L _ D OW N T _ N OW .
Fame and money followed. :: F EY M _ AH N D _ M AH N IY _ F AA L OW D .
Bomber was not amused. :: B AA M ER _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH M Y UW Z D .
They're just a nonsense. :: DH EH R _ JH AH S T _ AH _ N AA N S EH N S .
I am so, so, so lucky. :: AY _ AE M _ S OW , S OW , S OW _ L AH K IY .
Where does it come from? :: W EH R _ D AH Z _ IH T _ K AH M _ F R AH M ?
I put pressure on him. :: AY _ P UH T _ P R EH SH ER _ AA N _ HH IH M .
They will be dealt with. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ B IY _ D EH L T _ W IH DH .
The truth is otherwise. :: DH AH _ T R UW TH _ IH Z _ AH DH ER W AY Z .
There is no more money. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ M AO R _ M AH N IY .
We've got the top three. :: W IY V _ G AA T _ DH AH _ T AA P _ TH R IY .
It was our time maybe. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AW ER _ T AY M _ M EY B IY .
I am not a paedophile. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ AH _ P EH D OW F AY L .
There are no excuses. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ N OW _ IH K S K Y UW S IH Z .
I am not a magician. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ AH _ M AH JH IH SH AH N .
They did not interfere. :: DH EY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ IH N T ER F IH R .
We began to walk down. :: W IY _ B IH G AE N _ T UW _ W AO K _ D AW N .
That's why he visited. :: DH AE T S _ W AY _ HH IY _ V IH Z AH T AH D .
It could take three days. :: IH T _ K UH D _ T EY K _ TH R IY _ D EY Z .
I can't blame the fans. :: AY _ K AE N T _ B L EY M _ DH AH _ F AE N Z .
It's really nothing new. :: IH T S _ R IH L IY _ N AH TH IH NG _ N UW .
It's about the balance. :: IH T S _ AH B AW T _ DH AH _ B AE L AH N S .
And he's not a bigot. :: AH N D _ HH IY Z _ N AA T _ AH _ B IH G AH T .
The signs are positive. :: DH AH _ S AY N Z _ AA R _ P AA Z AH T IH V .
We deserved to win it. :: W IY _ D IH Z ER V D _ T UW _ W IH N _ IH T .
And did they have sex? :: AH N D _ D IH D _ DH EY _ HH AE V _ S EH K S ?
They are now collapsing. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N AW _ K AH L AE P S IH NG .
That, though, is not true. :: DH AE T , DH OW , IH Z _ N AA T _ T R UW .
No-one thought about this. :: _ N UW N _ TH AO T _ AH B AW T _ DH IH S .
We have to go for it. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G OW _ F AO R _ IH T .
That was a good effort. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G UH D _ EH F ER T .
It's always a dilemma. :: IH T S _ AO L W EY Z _ AH _ D IH L EH M AH .
Who are the democrats? :: HH UW _ AA R _ DH AH _ D EH M AH K R AE T S ?
That was not the norm. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ N AO R M .
I am proud of my team. :: AY _ AE M _ P R AW D _ AH V _ M AY _ T IY M .
She makes me so happy. :: SH IY _ M EY K S _ M IY _ S OW _ HH AE P IY .
But it didn't happen. :: B AH T _ IH T _ D IH D AH N T _ HH AE P AH N .
For once he was wrong. :: F AO R _ W AH N S _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ R AO NG .
We are really impressed. :: W IY _ AA R _ R IH L IY _ IH M P R EH S T .
That is the way it is. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ W EY _ IH T _ IH Z .
Does it make a profit? :: D AH Z _ IH T _ M EY K _ AH _ P R AA F AH T ?
So far, it is no more. :: S OW _ F AA R , IH T _ IH Z _ N OW _ M AO R .
But there are no plans. :: B AH T _ DH EH R _ AA R _ N OW _ P L AE N Z .
This is not a crisis. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ K R AY S AH S .
He did it all for us. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ IH T _ AO L _ F AO R _ AH S .
Plot is not the issue. :: P L AA T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ IH SH UW .
We're going to rebuild. :: W IY R _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ R IY B IH L D .
We have not given up. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ G IH V AH N _ AH P .
No-one knows the numbers. :: _ N UW N _ N OW Z _ DH AH _ N AH M B ER Z .
He was extremely ill. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ IH L .
It's going to be tough. :: IH T S _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ B IY _ T AH F .
That is just not true. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ JH AH S T _ N AA T _ T R UW .
But they have the sound. :: B AH T _ DH EY _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ S AW N D .
These days are long gone. :: DH IY Z _ D EY Z _ AA R _ L AO NG _ G AO N .
It is too much for me. :: IH T _ IH Z _ T UW _ M AH CH _ F AO R _ M IY .
Donald was his friend. :: D AA N AH L D _ W AA Z _ HH IH Z _ F R EH N D .
She died in middle age. :: SH IY _ D AY D _ IH N _ M IH D AH L _ EY JH .
There was no time scale. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ T AY M _ S K EY L .
Who would be a referee? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ B IY _ AH _ R EH F ER IY ?
It was by the numbers. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ B AY _ DH AH _ N AH M B ER Z .
I put the drawing down. :: AY _ P UH T _ DH AH _ D R AO IH NG _ D AW N .
It's that sort of night. :: IH T S _ DH AE T _ S AO R T _ AH V _ N AY T .
Well, he is an artist. :: W EH L , HH IY _ IH Z _ AE N _ AA R T AH S T .
It was not an insult. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AE N _ IH N S AH L T .
It sounded like a bomb. :: IH T _ S AW N D AH D _ L AY K _ AH _ B AA M .
It's not that clear-cut. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ DH AE T _ K L IH R K AH T .
We were extremely poor. :: W IY _ W ER _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ P UH R .
That would be a danger. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ B IY _ AH _ D EY N JH ER .
I had to be into it. :: AY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ B IY _ IH N T UW _ IH T .
They did the right thing. :: DH EY _ D IH D _ DH AH _ R AY T _ TH IH NG .
Tiger is not the norm. :: T AY G ER _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ N AO R M .
He was forced to quit. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ F AO R S T _ T UW _ K W IH T .
It is a good lifestyle. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ G UH D _ L AY F S T AY L .
Is there on his hands? :: IH Z _ DH EH R _ AA N _ HH IH Z _ HH AE N D Z ?
It is hard to believe. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH AA R D _ T UW _ B IH L IY V .
The red card was okay. :: DH AH _ R EH D _ K AA R D _ W AA Z _ OW K EY .
This is the last straw. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ L AE S T _ S T R AO .
I am a wealthy person. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ W EH L TH IY _ P ER S AH N .
This is the first step. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ F ER S T _ S T EH P .
I felt about this big. :: AY _ F EH L T _ AH B AW T _ DH IH S _ B IH G .
Gold admitted as much. :: G OW L D _ AH D M IH T AH D _ AE Z _ M AH CH .
Someone should tell them. :: S AH M W AH N _ SH UH D _ T EH L _ DH EH M .
It seems to have worked. :: IH T _ S IY M Z _ T UW _ HH AE V _ W ER K T .
They are not advertised. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N AA T _ AE D V ER T AY Z D .
It's like a basketball. :: IH T S _ L AY K _ AH _ B AE S K AH T B AO L .
Emotions were complex. :: IH M OW SH AH N Z _ W ER _ K AA M P L EH K S .
It will now be revived. :: IH T _ W IH L _ N AW _ B IY _ R IH V AY V D .
They are defined by law. :: DH EY _ AA R _ D IH F AY N D _ B AY _ L AO .
It is a complex deal. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ K AA M P L EH K S _ D IY L .
You are looking at him. :: Y UW _ AA R _ L UH K IH NG _ AE T _ HH IH M .
We've all had the shots. :: W IY V _ AO L _ HH AE D _ DH AH _ SH AA T S .
You didn't need to pay. :: Y UW _ D IH D AH N T _ N IY D _ T UW _ P EY .
Others are not so sure. :: AH DH ER Z _ AA R _ N AA T _ S OW _ SH UH R .
We're all paying for it. :: W IY R _ AO L _ P EY IH NG _ F AO R _ IH T .
From it emerged a cup. :: F R AH M _ IH T _ IH M ER JH D _ AH _ K AH P .
My office is down there. :: M AY _ AO F AH S _ IH Z _ D AW N _ DH EH R .
It is a very sad day. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ S AE D _ D EY .
The next one comes up. :: DH AH _ N EH K S T _ W AH N _ K AH M Z _ AH P .
Will he be given time? :: W IH L _ HH IY _ B IY _ G IH V AH N _ T AY M ?
Horses have some sense. :: HH AO R S AH Z _ HH AE V _ S AH M _ S EH N S .
There was no happiness. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ HH AE P IY N AH S .
Sure, we have problems. :: SH UH R , W IY _ HH AE V _ P R AA B L AH M Z .
That's my big challenge. :: DH AE T S _ M AY _ B IH G _ CH AE L AH N JH .
Some were close to tears. :: S AH M _ W ER _ K L OW S _ T UW _ T EH R Z .
She is a great talent. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ T AE L AH N T .
It looks like paradise. :: IH T _ L UH K S _ L AY K _ P EH R AH D AY S .
There was no cohesion. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ K OW HH IY ZH AH N .
And we're not there yet. :: AH N D _ W IY R _ N AA T _ DH EH R _ Y EH T .
We are at a crossroads. :: W IY _ AA R _ AE T _ AH _ K R AO S R OW D Z .
I love a clever reader. :: AY _ L AH V _ AH _ K L EH V ER _ R IY D ER .
Do not listen to them. :: D UW _ N AA T _ L IH S AH N _ T UW _ DH EH M .
It is too early to say. :: IH T _ IH Z _ T UW _ ER L IY _ T UW _ S EY .
Are they control freaks? :: AA R _ DH EY _ K AH N T R OW L _ F R IY K S ?
It's a hidden problem. :: IH T S _ AH _ HH IH D AH N _ P R AA B L AH M .
I believe in the Church. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ DH AH _ CH ER CH .
We've got a job to do. :: W IY V _ G AA T _ AH _ JH AA B _ T UW _ D UW .
He's got me very well. :: HH IY Z _ G AA T _ M IY _ V EH R IY _ W EH L .
But no, it's not funny. :: B AH T _ N OW , IH T S _ N AA T _ F AH N IY .
Faces from the Eighties. :: F EY S AH Z _ F R AH M _ DH AH _ EY T IY Z .
Yes, it was uplifting. :: Y EH S , IH T _ W AA Z _ AH P L IH F T IH NG .
It's a personal matter. :: IH T S _ AH _ P ER S IH N IH L _ M AE T ER .
It was a new ball game. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ N UW _ B AO L _ G EY M .
It is highly unlikely. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH AY L IY _ AH N L AY K L IY .
My body is exhausted. :: M AY _ B AA D IY _ IH Z _ IH G Z AO S T AH D .
Which, in effect, it is. :: W IH CH , IH N _ IH F EH K T , IH T _ IH Z .
As if they ever stopped. :: AE Z _ IH F _ DH EY _ EH V ER _ S T AA P T .
I'm feeling pretty good. :: AY M _ F IY L IH NG _ P R IH T IY _ G UH D .
I looked forward to it. :: AY _ L UH K T _ F AO R W ER D _ T UW _ IH T .
Who would have thought it? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ TH AO T _ IH T ?
We told them in July. :: W IY _ T OW L D _ DH EH M _ IH N _ JH UW L AY .
It's a national sport. :: IH T S _ AH _ N AE SH AH N AH L _ S P AO R T .
How can you not react? :: HH AW _ K AE N _ Y UW _ N AA T _ R IY AE K T ?
It is very difficult. :: IH T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ D IH F AH K AH L T .
Our position is clear. :: AW ER _ P AH Z IH SH AH N _ IH Z _ K L IH R .
It's our worst nightmare. :: IH T S _ AW ER _ W ER S T _ N AY T M EH R .
The problem is Labour. :: DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M _ IH Z _ L EY B AW R .
She was my big sister. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ M AY _ B IH G _ S IH S T ER .
He took my breath away. :: HH IY _ T UH K _ M AY _ B R EH TH _ AH W EY .
He loved his children. :: HH IY _ L AH V D _ HH IH Z _ CH IH L D R AH N .
Let's not go overboard. :: L EH T S _ N AA T _ G OW _ OW V ER B AO R D .
There is no going back. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ G OW IH NG _ B AE K .
It was pretty special. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ P R IH T IY _ S P EH SH AH L .
The second is freedom. :: DH AH _ S EH K AH N D _ IH Z _ F R IY D AH M .
Not that it is unique. :: N AA T _ DH AE T _ IH T _ IH Z _ Y UW N IY K .
It is a daunting task. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ D AO N T IH NG _ T AE S K .
But what did it matter? :: B AH T _ W AH T _ D IH D _ IH T _ M AE T ER ?
But it does not matter. :: B AH T _ IH T _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ M AE T ER .
That is exactly right. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ IH G Z AE K T L IY _ R AY T .
I had nothing to lose. :: AY _ HH AE D _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ L UW Z .
I cannot really commit. :: AY _ K AE N AA T _ R IH L IY _ K AH M IH T .
This is not quite right. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ K W AY T _ R AY T .
I am an innocent man. :: AY _ AE M _ AE N _ IH N AH S AH N T _ M AE N .
But he did not appear. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ AH P IH R .
I don't believe in God. :: AY _ D OW N T _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ G AA D .
This is very bad news. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ B AE D _ N UW Z .
It is all in the mind. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AO L _ IH N _ DH AH _ M AY N D .
WHO would have thought it? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ TH AO T _ IH T ?
I can understand that. :: AY _ K AE N _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ DH AE T .
You will gain from that. :: Y UW _ W IH L _ G EY N _ F R AH M _ DH AE T .
I'm really proud of her. :: AY M _ R IH L IY _ P R AW D _ AH V _ HH ER .
That has to be allowed. :: DH AE T _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ B IY _ AH L AW D .
Their families are gone. :: DH EH R _ F AE M AH L IY Z _ AA R _ G AO N .
I thought they played well. :: AY _ TH AO T _ DH EY _ P L EY D _ W EH L .
They need time to think. :: DH EY _ N IY D _ T AY M _ T UW _ TH IH NG K .
And this was well known? :: AH N D _ DH IH S _ W AA Z _ W EH L _ N OW N ?
That was something else. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ S AH M TH IH NG _ EH L S .
What do we have to do? :: W AH T _ D UW _ W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ D UW ?
Father is on the train. :: F AA DH ER _ IH Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ T R EY N .
Not that he's declined. :: N AA T _ DH AE T _ HH IY Z _ D IH K L AY N D .
That is my commitment. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ M AY _ K AH M IH T M AH N T .
It's harder, believe me. :: IH T S _ HH AA R D ER , B IH L IY V _ M IY .
he announced his plans. :: HH IY _ AH N AW N S T _ HH IH Z _ P L AE N Z .
We're going to fight it. :: W IY R _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ F AY T _ IH T .
Now we have had enough. :: N AW _ W IY _ HH AE V _ HH AE D _ IH N AH F .
You have to go for it. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G OW _ F AO R _ IH T .
Where is the discipline? :: W EH R _ IH Z _ DH AH _ D IH S AH P L AH N ?
I have learned from him. :: AY _ HH AE V _ L ER N D _ F R AH M _ HH IH M .
We are in the end game. :: W IY _ AA R _ IH N _ DH AH _ EH N D _ G EY M .
He took over our lives. :: HH IY _ T UH K _ OW V ER _ AW ER _ L IH V Z .
He was a home referee. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH OW M _ R EH F ER IY .
So I got a blood test. :: S OW _ AY _ G AA T _ AH _ B L AH D _ T EH S T .
But he has a lifeline. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ HH AE Z _ AH _ L AY F L AY N .
Every one is a winner. :: EH V ER IY _ W AH N _ IH Z _ AH _ W IH N ER .
Is there on his hands? :: IH Z _ DH EH R _ AA N _ HH IH Z _ HH AE N D Z ?
It's not even finished. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ IY V IH N _ F IH N IH SH T .
Johnson was pretty low. :: JH AA N S AH N _ W AA Z _ P R IH T IY _ L OW .
I am an estate agent. :: AY _ AE M _ AE N _ IH S T EY T _ EY JH AH N T .
It is simply not true. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S IH M P L IY _ N AA T _ T R UW .
I'd never run for them. :: AY D _ N EH V ER _ R AH N _ F AO R _ DH EH M .
War is not the action. :: W AO R _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ AE K SH AH N .
The clarity is vital. :: DH AH _ K L EH R AH T IY _ IH Z _ V AY T AH L .
We agreed to disagree. :: W IY _ AH G R IY D _ T UW _ D IH S AH G R IY .
It was sold at a loss. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S OW L D _ AE T _ AH _ L AO S .
I will be in Scotland. :: AY _ W IH L _ B IY _ IH N _ S K AA T L AH N D .
But it was also hard. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ AO L S OW _ HH AA R D .
And he's the real thing. :: AH N D _ HH IY Z _ DH AH _ R IY L _ TH IH NG .
A lot has been written. :: AH _ L AA T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ R IH T AH N .
I chose to make a film. :: AY _ CH OW Z _ T UW _ M EY K _ AH _ F IH L M .
They never gave up hope. :: DH EY _ N EH V ER _ G EY V _ AH P _ HH OW P .
They are different types. :: DH EY _ AA R _ D IH F ER AH N T _ T AY P S .
He is too weak to move. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ T UW _ W IY K _ T UW _ M UW V .
He got the same story. :: HH IY _ G AA T _ DH AH _ S EY M _ S T AO R IY .
Who did the recruiting? :: HH UW _ D IH D _ DH AH _ R AH K R UW T IH NG ?
The scene is about this? :: DH AH _ S IY N _ IH Z _ AH B AW T _ DH IH S ?
That will be the office. :: DH AE T _ W IH L _ B IY _ DH AH _ AO F AH S .
I didn't see the point. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ S IY _ DH AH _ P OY N T .
But it was a struggle. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ S T R AH G AH L .
You feel very helpless. :: Y UW _ F IY L _ V EH R IY _ HH EH L P L AH S .
She was an only child. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ AE N _ OW N L IY _ CH AY L D .
Let's hope that it does. :: L EH T S _ HH OW P _ DH AE T _ IH T _ D AH Z .
It is high time to act. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH AY _ T AY M _ T UW _ AE K T .
We knew they could do it. :: W IY _ N UW _ DH EY _ K UH D _ D UW _ IH T .
They had three children. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ TH R IY _ CH IH L D R AH N .
It was a great evening. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ IY V N IH NG .
He had served his time. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ S ER V D _ HH IH Z _ T AY M .
It happened so quickly. :: IH T _ HH AE P AH N D _ S OW _ K W IH K L IY .
Words were not required. :: W ER D Z _ W ER _ N AA T _ R IY K W AY ER D .
The car was just there. :: DH AH _ K AA R _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ DH EH R .
It is a terrible loss. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ T EH R AH B AH L _ L AO S .
We will be victorious. :: W IY _ W IH L _ B IY _ V IH K T AO R IY AH S .
I was just overwhelmed. :: AY _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ OW V ER W EH L M D .
Time is now very short. :: T AY M _ IH Z _ N AW _ V EH R IY _ SH AO R T .
how do you get it back? :: HH AW _ D UW _ Y UW _ G EH T _ IH T _ B AE K ?
You have made your point. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ M EY D _ Y AO R _ P OY N T .
Got to win today, though. :: G AA T _ T UW _ W IH N _ T AH D EY , DH OW .
He deserves a top team. :: HH IY _ D IH Z ER V Z _ AH _ T AA P _ T IY M .
Anyone else can apply. :: EH N IY W AH N _ EH L S _ K AE N _ AH P L AY .
They must put them back. :: DH EY _ M AH S T _ P UH T _ DH EH M _ B AE K .
It would also take time. :: IH T _ W UH D _ AO L S OW _ T EY K _ T AY M .
She is fulfilled by it. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ F UH L F IH L D _ B AY _ IH T .
These things can happen. :: DH IY Z _ TH IH NG Z _ K AE N _ HH AE P AH N .
I had found my vision. :: AY _ HH AE D _ F AW N D _ M AY _ V IH ZH AH N .
I remember it clearly. :: AY _ R IH M EH M B ER _ IH T _ K L IH R L IY .
I'm sure it will go on. :: AY M _ SH UH R _ IH T _ W IH L _ G OW _ AA N .
I love this tournament. :: AY _ L AH V _ DH IH S _ T UH R N AH M AH N T .
I am not a happy man. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ AH _ HH AE P IY _ M AE N .
I'm not afraid of that. :: AY M _ N AA T _ AH F R EY D _ AH V _ DH AE T .
I didn't have a trio. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ HH AE V _ AH _ T R IY OW .
Do what you have to do. :: D UW _ W AH T _ Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ D UW .
There is no substitute. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ S AH B S T AH T UW T .
Did you get the script? :: D IH D _ Y UW _ G EH T _ DH AH _ S K R IH P T ?
I see that any day now. :: AY _ S IY _ DH AE T _ EH N IY _ D EY _ N AW .
We had no part in it. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ P AA R T _ IH N _ IH T .
We could do a lot worse. :: W IY _ K UH D _ D UW _ AH _ L AA T _ W ER S .
And they did just that. :: AH N D _ DH EY _ D IH D _ JH AH S T _ DH AE T .
I was very fortunate. :: AY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ F AO R CH AH N AH T .
We never agreed to it. :: W IY _ N EH V ER _ AH G R IY D _ T UW _ IH T .
Drugs are getting through. :: D R AH G Z _ AA R _ G EH T IH NG _ TH R UW .
This is wonderful news. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ W AH N D ER F AH L _ N UW Z .
There was only silence. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ OW N L IY _ S AY L AH N S .
Both men were uninjured. :: B OW TH _ M EH N _ W ER _ AH N IH N JH ER D .
I just wanted to fly. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ W AA N T AH D _ T UW _ F L AY .
He did not report it. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ R IY P AO R T _ IH T .
This is a huge event. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ HH Y UW JH _ IH V EH N T .
Are you up for business? :: AA R _ Y UW _ AH P _ F AO R _ B IH Z N AH S ?
She is not in a coma. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ IH N _ AH _ K OW M AH .
It would be a miracle. :: IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ AH _ M IH R AH K AH L .
He just wants to play. :: HH IY _ JH AH S T _ W AA N T S _ T UW _ P L EY .
But these were the nights. :: B AH T _ DH IY Z _ W ER _ DH AH _ N AY T S .
That was their attitude. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH EH R _ AE T AH T UW D .
It's much more dynamic. :: IH T S _ M AH CH _ M AO R _ D AY N AE M IH K .
It is the way they work. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ W EY _ DH EY _ W ER K .
Are you from the rugby? :: AA R _ Y UW _ F R AH M _ DH AH _ R AH G B IY ?
That would be dangerous. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ B IY _ D EY N JH ER AH S .
I want to keep playing. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ K IY P _ P L EY IH NG .
It's good for the city. :: IH T S _ G UH D _ F AO R _ DH AH _ S IH T IY .
But this is even worse. :: B AH T _ DH IH S _ IH Z _ IY V IH N _ W ER S .
We did it in one take. :: W IY _ D IH D _ IH T _ IH N _ W AH N _ T EY K .
We're very, very happy. :: W IY R _ V EH R IY , V EH R IY _ HH AE P IY .
Sadly, he has a point. :: S AE D L IY , HH IY _ HH AE Z _ AH _ P OY N T .
The lottery has helped. :: DH AH _ L AA T ER IY _ HH AE Z _ HH EH L P T .
No, they have played well. :: N OW , DH EY _ HH AE V _ P L EY D _ W EH L .
The police are hopeless. :: DH AH _ P AH L IY S _ AA R _ HH OW P L AH S .
Well, that was the plan. :: W EH L , DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ P L AE N .
We're talking to the US. :: W IY R _ T AO K IH NG _ T UW _ DH AH _ AH S .
He would have been wrong. :: HH IY _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ R AO NG .
There was no commission. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ K AH M IH SH AH N .
It was very exciting. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ IH K S AY T IH NG .
There is a lot of fear. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ F IH R .
I've heard it all before. :: AY V _ HH ER D _ IH T _ AO L _ B IH F AO R .
That tells you something. :: DH AE T _ T EH L Z _ Y UW _ S AH M TH IH NG .
It was not a cover-up. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH _ K AH V ER AH P .
I have nothing to lose. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ L UW Z .
It is a hobby for me. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ HH AA B IY _ F AO R _ M IY .
They are very frightened. :: DH EY _ AA R _ V EH R IY _ F R AY T AH N D .
I'm very happy tonight. :: AY M _ V EH R IY _ HH AE P IY _ T AH N AY T .
I just know it's a lot. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ N OW _ IH T S _ AH _ L AA T .
He then did just that. :: HH IY _ DH EH N _ D IH D _ JH AH S T _ DH AE T .
That's a concern to me. :: DH AE T S _ AH _ K AH N S ER N _ T UW _ M IY .
We never publicise it. :: W IY _ N EH V ER _ P AH B L IH S AY Z _ IH T .
I was a silly bastard. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AH _ S IH L IY _ B AE S T ER D .
It is all very upbeat. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AO L _ V EH R IY _ AH P B IY T .
Neither had the public. :: N IY DH ER _ HH AE D _ DH AH _ P AH B L IH K .
It's not an impression. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AE N _ IH M P R EH SH AH N .
So, we have to go back. :: S OW , W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G OW _ B AE K .
You should enjoy the day. :: Y UW _ SH UH D _ EH N JH OY _ DH AH _ D EY .
The omens are not good. :: DH AH _ OW M AH N Z _ AA R _ N AA T _ G UH D .
It was just a feeling. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AH _ F IY L IH NG .
He is very sensitive. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ S EH N S AH T IH V .
I have to accept that. :: AY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ AE K S EH P T _ DH AE T .
The timing is obvious. :: DH AH _ T AY M IH NG _ IH Z _ AA B V IY AH S .
They went down together. :: DH EY _ W EH N T _ D AW N _ T AH G EH DH ER .
It's going to be great! :: IH T S _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ B IY _ G R EY T !
That is our objective. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AW ER _ AH B JH EH K T IH V .
But that is not enough. :: B AH T _ DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ IH N AH F .
He is the man to beat. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ DH AH _ M AE N _ T UW _ B IY T .
There are two characters. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ T UW _ K AE R IH K T ER Z .
It's not going to work. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ W ER K .
I've got nothing to say. :: AY V _ G AA T _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ S EY .
I can handle the pace. :: AY _ K AE N _ HH AE N D AH L _ DH AH _ P EY S .
This is very good news. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ G UH D _ N UW Z .
We just do not do it. :: W IY _ JH AH S T _ D UW _ N AA T _ D UW _ IH T .
I fell in love with it. :: AY _ F EH L _ IH N _ L AH V _ W IH DH _ IH T .
My game is coming back. :: M AY _ G EY M _ IH Z _ K AH M IH NG _ B AE K .
We are all very pleased. :: W IY _ AA R _ AO L _ V EH R IY _ P L IY Z D .
It goes back a long way. :: IH T _ G OW Z _ B AE K _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY .
It is the whole package. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ HH OW L _ P AE K AH JH .
We will turn the corner. :: W IY _ W IH L _ T ER N _ DH AH _ K AO R N ER .
I had a train to catch. :: AY _ HH AE D _ AH _ T R EY N _ T UW _ K AE CH .
But I am a worried man. :: B AH T _ AY _ AE M _ AH _ W ER IY D _ M AE N .
Even the one she loved. :: IY V IH N _ DH AH _ W AH N _ SH IY _ L AH V D .
You are like an animal. :: Y UW _ AA R _ L AY K _ AE N _ AE N AH M AH L .
He's not a Celtic man. :: HH IY Z _ N AA T _ AH _ S EH L T IH K _ M AE N .
how do you get it back? :: HH AW _ D UW _ Y UW _ G EH T _ IH T _ B AE K ?
This is a big step up. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ B IH G _ S T EH P _ AH P .
We need to be prepared. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ B IY _ P R IY P EH R D .
It's that kind of place. :: IH T S _ DH AE T _ K AY N D _ AH V _ P L EY S .
She should not be blamed. :: SH IY _ SH UH D _ N AA T _ B IY _ B L EY M D .
As, indeed, they would be. :: AE Z , IH N D IY D , DH EY _ W UH D _ B IY .
I've not thought about it. :: AY V _ N AA T _ TH AO T _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
It is on the internet. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ IH N T ER N EH T .
How do you get it back? :: HH AW _ D UW _ Y UW _ G EH T _ IH T _ B AE K ?
This ruling is a farce. :: DH IH S _ R UW L IH NG _ IH Z _ AH _ F AA R S .
But one was not enough. :: B AH T _ W AH N _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ IH N AH F .
What are you no good at? :: W AH T _ AA R _ Y UW _ N OW _ G UH D _ AE T ?
This could be a mistake. :: DH IH S _ K UH D _ B IY _ AH _ M IH S T EY K .
He pleaded for caution. :: HH IY _ P L IY D AH D _ F AO R _ K AA SH AH N .
Broke the birdie record. :: B R OW K _ DH AH _ B ER D IY _ R AH K AO R D .
The scene is about this? :: DH AH _ S IY N _ IH Z _ AH B AW T _ DH IH S ?
It is legally binding. :: IH T _ IH Z _ L IY G AH L IY _ B AY N D IH NG .
You have to be patient. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ B IY _ P EY SH AH N T .
That could be a mistake. :: DH AE T _ K UH D _ B IY _ AH _ M IH S T EY K .
I have had a good life. :: AY _ HH AE V _ HH AE D _ AH _ G UH D _ L AY F .
They have not been named. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ B IH N _ N EY M D .
It has to be enforced. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ B IY _ EH N F AO R S T .
The answer was in space. :: DH AH _ AE N S ER _ W AA Z _ IH N _ S P EY S .
Taxes may need to rise. :: T AE K S AH Z _ M EY _ N IY D _ T UW _ R AY Z .
The staff are very good. :: DH AH _ S T AE F _ AA R _ V EH R IY _ G UH D .
It's going to be epic. :: IH T S _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ B IY _ EH P IH K .
I am totally surprised. :: AY _ AE M _ T OW T AH L IY _ S ER P R AY Z D .
Henman has been warned. :: HH EH N M AH N _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ W AO R N D .

There was a hole in it. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH OW L _ IH N _ IH T .
There's no place to hide. :: DH EH R Z _ N OW _ P L EY S _ T UW _ HH AY D .
I just wanted a break. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ W AA N T AH D _ AH _ B R EY K .
They were worth the money. :: DH EY _ W ER _ W ER TH _ DH AH _ M AH N IY .
It was a narrow escape. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ N EH R OW _ IH S K EY P .
He was not a big name. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH _ B IH G _ N EY M .
Eight others have followed. :: EY T _ AH DH ER Z _ HH AE V _ F AA L OW D .
All films open tomorrow :: AO L _ F IH L M Z _ OW P AH N _ T AH M AA R OW
Paul never gave up hope. :: P AO L _ N EH V ER _ G EY V _ AH P _ HH OW P .
We lost to a poor team. :: W IY _ L AO S T _ T UW _ AH _ P UH R _ T IY M .
An appeal was unlikely. :: AE N _ AH P IY L _ W AA Z _ AH N L AY K L IY .
My husband was angry. :: M AY _ HH AH Z B AH N D _ W AA Z _ AE NG G R IY .
He said the right things. :: HH IY _ S EH D _ DH AH _ R AY T _ TH IH NG Z .
It's a big deal for me. :: IH T S _ AH _ B IH G _ D IY L _ F AO R _ M IY .
He has real potential. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ R IY L _ P AH T EH N SH AH L .
I'm delighted for Andy. :: AY M _ D IH L AY T AH D _ F AO R _ AE N D IY .
He can win every week. :: HH IY _ K AE N _ W IH N _ EH V ER IY _ W IY K .
But we are a young side. :: B AH T _ W IY _ AA R _ AH _ Y AH NG _ S AY D .
The pressure is on them. :: DH AH _ P R EH SH ER _ IH Z _ AA N _ DH EH M .
And we were very lucky. :: AH N D _ W IY _ W ER _ V EH R IY _ L AH K IY .
He had returned to die. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ R IH T ER N D _ T UW _ D AY .
What's happening to her? :: W AH T S _ HH AE P AH N IH NG _ T UW _ HH ER ?
I have nothing to hide. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ HH AY D .
You can't believe a word. :: Y UW _ K AE N T _ B IH L IY V _ AH _ W ER D .
Are we going mainstream? :: AA R _ W IY _ G OW IH NG _ M EY N S T R IY M ?
What do they do, anyway? :: W AH T _ D UW _ DH EY _ D UW , EH N IY W EY ?
Where are you taking her? :: W EH R _ AA R _ Y UW _ T EY K IH NG _ HH ER ?
They are not falling now. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N AA T _ F AA L IH NG _ N AW .
He was caught and fired. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ K AA T _ AH N D _ F AY ER D .
We are losing this war. :: W IY _ AA R _ L UW Z IH NG _ DH IH S _ W AO R .
Sub Not Used, McKenzie. :: S AH B _ N AA T _ Y UW Z D , M AH K EH N Z IY .
Promises were not kept. :: P R AA M AH S AH Z _ W ER _ N AA T _ K EH P T .
I will not be pressured. :: AY _ W IH L _ N AA T _ B IY _ P R EH SH ER D .
I had another good day. :: AY _ HH AE D _ AH N AH DH ER _ G UH D _ D EY .
I'm just doing artwork. :: AY M _ JH AH S T _ D UW IH NG _ AA R T W ER K .
It is not an amnesty. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AE N _ AE M N AH S T IY .
It broke up my marriage. :: IH T _ B R OW K _ AH P _ M AY _ M EH R IH JH .
We will not break even. :: W IY _ W IH L _ N AA T _ B R EY K _ IY V IH N .
I have found my vision. :: AY _ HH AE V _ F AW N D _ M AY _ V IH ZH AH N .
The English are coming. :: DH AH _ IH NG G L IH SH _ AA R _ K AH M IH NG .
I was frustrated here. :: AY _ W AA Z _ F R AH S T R EY T AH D _ HH IY R .
What's it for, after all? :: W AH T S _ IH T _ F AO R , AE F T ER _ AO L ?
She looked very settled. :: SH IY _ L UH K T _ V EH R IY _ S EH T AH L D .
Parents should avoid it. :: P EH R AH N T S _ SH UH D _ AH V OY D _ IH T .
There is no easy answer. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ IY Z IY _ AE N S ER .
We act because we must. :: W IY _ AE K T _ B IH K AO Z _ W IY _ M AH S T .
I'm not a fan of books. :: AY M _ N AA T _ AH _ F AE N _ AH V _ B UH K S .
I'm a little bit tired. :: AY M _ AH _ L IH T AH L _ B IH T _ T AY ER D .
It has until Saturday. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ AH N T IH L _ S AE T ER D IY .
It is not a wish list. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ W IH SH _ L IH S T .
It does seem a mystery. :: IH T _ D AH Z _ S IY M _ AH _ M IH S T ER IY .
I have been to see him. :: AY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ T UW _ S IY _ HH IH M .
It was set in a cafe. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S EH T _ IH N _ AH _ K AH F EY .
We find this very sad. :: W IY _ F AY N D _ DH IH S _ V EH R IY _ S AE D .
That is the key message. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K IY _ M EH S AH JH .
He told the conference. :: HH IY _ T OW L D _ DH AH _ K AA N F ER AH N S .
Why does it come out now? :: W AY _ D AH Z _ IH T _ K AH M _ AW T _ N AW ?
It would be that absurd. :: IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ DH AE T _ AH B S ER D .
This could be wonderful. :: DH IH S _ K UH D _ B IY _ W AH N D ER F AH L .
It does nothing for me. :: IH T _ D AH Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ F AO R _ M IY .
I would love to do that. :: AY _ W UH D _ L AH V _ T UW _ D UW _ DH AE T .
Is that what it's about? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ W AH T _ IH T S _ AH B AW T ?
I go in for the parts. :: AY _ G OW _ IH N _ F AO R _ DH AH _ P AA R T S .
It should be the reverse. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY _ DH AH _ R IH V ER S .
It's about doing things. :: IH T S _ AH B AW T _ D UW IH NG _ TH IH NG Z .
There was no argument. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ AA R G Y AH M AH N T .
Our thoughts are with her. :: AW ER _ TH AO T S _ AA R _ W IH DH _ HH ER .
He didn't let me down. :: HH IY _ D IH D AH N T _ L EH T _ M IY _ D AW N .
That's a big reduction. :: DH AE T S _ AH _ B IH G _ R AH D AH K SH AH N .
We are working so hard. :: W IY _ AA R _ W ER K IH NG _ S OW _ HH AA R D .
What was all that about? :: W AH T _ W AA Z _ AO L _ DH AE T _ AH B AW T ?
Then there's the casting. :: DH EH N _ DH EH R Z _ DH AH _ K AE S T IH NG .
They seem to be, anyway. :: DH EY _ S IY M _ T UW _ B IY , EH N IY W EY .
Well, you don't have time. :: W EH L , Y UW _ D OW N T _ HH AE V _ T AY M .
What was that all about? :: W AH T _ W AA Z _ DH AE T _ AO L _ AH B AW T ?
Do what you want to do. :: D UW _ W AH T _ Y UW _ W AA N T _ T UW _ D UW .
It is good news for us. :: IH T _ IH Z _ G UH D _ N UW Z _ F AO R _ AH S .
The programme was awful. :: DH AH _ P R OW G R AE M _ W AA Z _ AA F AH L .
You can't really compare. :: Y UW _ K AE N T _ R IH L IY _ K AH M P EH R .
This is not a problem. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
They were not consulted. :: DH EY _ W ER _ N AA T _ K AH N S AH L T AH D .
The concept is simple. :: DH AH _ K AA N S EH P T _ IH Z _ S IH M P AH L .
This one would have been. :: DH IH S _ W AH N _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N .
It does and it doesn't. :: IH T _ D AH Z _ AH N D _ IH T _ D AH Z AH N T .
I think, therefore I am? :: AY _ TH IH NG K , DH EH R F AO R _ AY _ AE M ?
And they were being paid? :: AH N D _ DH EY _ W ER _ B IY IH NG _ P EY D ?
The boat was fantastic. :: DH AH _ B OW T _ W AA Z _ F AE N T AE S T IH K .
It is a vicious circle. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ V IH SH AH S _ S ER K AH L .
It was a funny feeling. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ F AH N IY _ F IY L IH NG .
My daughter is an adult. :: M AY _ D AO T ER _ IH Z _ AE N _ AH D AH L T .
What form did that take? :: W AH T _ F AO R M _ D IH D _ DH AE T _ T EY K ?
This will impact on us. :: DH IH S _ W IH L _ IH M P AE K T _ AA N _ AH S .
He's a lovely young man. :: HH IY Z _ AH _ L AH V L IY _ Y AH NG _ M AE N .
It was bound to happen. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ B AW N D _ T UW _ HH AE P AH N .
It might change your life. :: IH T _ M AY T _ CH EY N JH _ Y AO R _ L AY F .
He has a lot of skill. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ S K IH L .
I think it's about time. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T S _ AH B AW T _ T AY M .
Dennis was not so sure. :: D EH N IH S _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ S OW _ SH UH R .
He has not been dropped. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ B IH N _ D R AA P T .
It was almost too much. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AO L M OW S T _ T UW _ M AH CH .
The trick is to try it. :: DH AH _ T R IH K _ IH Z _ T UW _ T R AY _ IH T .
He deserved a red card. :: HH IY _ D IH Z ER V D _ AH _ R EH D _ K AA R D .
He was a shooting star. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ SH UW T IH NG _ S T AA R .
That is the bottom line. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ B AA T AH M _ L AY N .
We work for the athlete. :: W IY _ W ER K _ F AO R _ DH AH _ AE TH L IY T .
He has really done well. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ R IH L IY _ D AH N _ W EH L .
We just have to adapt. :: W IY _ JH AH S T _ HH AE V _ T UW _ AH D AE P T .
She is in good spirits. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ IH N _ G UH D _ S P IH R AH T S .
That was just one night. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ W AH N _ N AY T .
She replied, It could be. :: SH IY _ R IH P L AY D , IH T _ K UH D _ B IY .
That was the first step. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ F ER S T _ S T EH P .
It still has an effect. :: IH T _ S T IH L _ HH AE Z _ AE N _ IH F EH K T .
Now comes the hard part. :: N AW _ K AH M Z _ DH AH _ HH AA R D _ P AA R T .
It seemed like four hours. :: IH T _ S IY M D _ L AY K _ F AO R _ AW ER Z .
Now the door has opened. :: N AW _ DH AH _ D AO R _ HH AE Z _ OW P AH N D .
Other teams moved up too. :: AH DH ER _ T IY M Z _ M UW V D _ AH P _ T UW .
I'm not sure that's right. :: AY M _ N AA T _ SH UH R _ DH AE T S _ R AY T .
We shall be victorious. :: W IY _ SH AE L _ B IY _ V IH K T AO R IY AH S .
We try to keep it right. :: W IY _ T R AY _ T UW _ K IY P _ IH T _ R AY T .
The Dow Jones is way up. :: DH AH _ D AW _ JH OW N Z _ IH Z _ W EY _ AH P .
Once again, he refused. :: W AH N S _ AH G EH N , HH IY _ R AH F Y UW Z D .
Is there a waiting list? :: IH Z _ DH EH R _ AH _ W EY T IH NG _ L IH S T ?
He left pretty quickly. :: HH IY _ L EH F T _ P R IH T IY _ K W IH K L IY .
I would not count on it. :: AY _ W UH D _ N AA T _ K AW N T _ AA N _ IH T .
The players will be down. :: DH AH _ P L EY ER Z _ W IH L _ B IY _ D AW N .
It needs a team approach. :: IH T _ N IY D Z _ AH _ T IY M _ AH P R OW CH .
But he gave no details. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ G EY V _ N OW _ D IH T EY L Z .
That was not due to me. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ D UW _ T UW _ M IY .
There's no choice is there? :: DH EH R Z _ N OW _ CH OY S _ IH Z _ DH EH R ?
This is a big, big win. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ B IH G , B IH G _ W IH N .
That is why we are here. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ W AY _ W IY _ AA R _ HH IY R .
This is simply unjust. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ S IH M P L IY _ AH N JH AH S T .
Three others were wounded. :: TH R IY _ AH DH ER Z _ W ER _ W UW N D AH D .
It's as simple as that. :: IH T S _ AE Z _ S IH M P AH L _ AE Z _ DH AE T .
That gives it a spirit. :: DH AE T _ G IH V Z _ IH T _ AH _ S P IH R AH T .
Sub Not Used, McArthur. :: S AH B _ N AA T _ Y UW Z D , M AH K AA R TH ER .
I'm going to buy a car. :: AY M _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ B AY _ AH _ K AA R .

I hope you miss the cut. :: AY _ HH OW P _ Y UW _ M IH S _ DH AH _ K AH T .
Do you come from Moscow? :: D UW _ Y UW _ K AH M _ F R AH M _ M AA S K OW ?
It was a job he loved. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ JH AA B _ HH IY _ L AH V D .
I've taken to the hills. :: AY V _ T EY K AH N _ T UW _ DH AH _ HH IH L Z .
That alibi is now gone. :: DH AE T _ AE L AH B AY _ IH Z _ N AW _ G AO N .
We told them in August. :: W IY _ T OW L D _ DH EH M _ IH N _ AA G AH S T .
It is not for me, though. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ F AO R _ M IY , DH OW .
I'm so proud of my team. :: AY M _ S OW _ P R AW D _ AH V _ M AY _ T IY M .
It's an internal matter. :: IH T S _ AE N _ IH N T ER N AH L _ M AE T ER .
The campaign was raucous. :: DH AH _ K AE M P EY N _ W AA Z _ R AO K AH S .
Planning is a key issue. :: P L AE N IH NG _ IH Z _ AH _ K IY _ IH SH UW .
That's my daughter acting. :: DH AE T S _ M AY _ D AO T ER _ AE K T IH NG .
There are many children. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ M EH N IY _ CH IH L D R AH N .
That never seemed likely. :: DH AE T _ N EH V ER _ S IY M D _ L AY K L IY .
It is good to look back. :: IH T _ IH Z _ G UH D _ T UW _ L UH K _ B AE K .
Our system is archaic. :: AW ER _ S IH S T AH M _ IH Z _ AA R K EY IH K .
Sandy was very active. :: S AE N D IY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ AE K T IH V .
Sub Not Used, McCulloch. :: S AH B _ N AA T _ Y UW Z D , M AH K AH L AH K .
I suspect that it will. :: AY _ S AH S P EH K T _ DH AE T _ IH T _ W IH L .
I can't believe the buzz. :: AY _ K AE N T _ B IH L IY V _ DH AH _ B AH Z .
Staff have been informed. :: S T AE F _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ IH N F AO R M D .
Now, that is a good deal. :: N AW , DH AE T _ IH Z _ AH _ G UH D _ D IY L .
I only half believe it. :: AY _ OW N L IY _ HH AE F _ B IH L IY V _ IH T .
You can't go on forever. :: Y UW _ K AE N T _ G OW _ AA N _ F ER EH V ER .
A counter reaction was. :: AH _ K AW N T ER _ R IY AE K SH AH N _ W AA Z .
There must be boundaries. :: DH EH R _ M AH S T _ B IY _ B AW N D ER IY Z .
Naturally, she said yes. :: N AE CH ER AH L IY , SH IY _ S EH D _ Y EH S .
This is totally untrue. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ T OW T AH L IY _ AH N T R UW .
What are you waiting for? :: W AH T _ AA R _ Y UW _ W EY T IH NG _ F AO R ?
It was extremely cold. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ K OW L D .
I can't deny that fact. :: AY _ K AE N T _ D IH N AY _ DH AE T _ F AE K T .
It all changes for her. :: IH T _ AO L _ CH EY N JH AH Z _ F AO R _ HH ER .
I think she is supreme. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ SH IY _ IH Z _ S AH P R IY M .
Now it's all written down. :: N AW _ IH T S _ AO L _ R IH T AH N _ D AW N .
I'm feeling very pleased. :: AY M _ F IY L IH NG _ V EH R IY _ P L IY Z D .
Chris is big and jolly. :: K R IH S _ IH Z _ B IH G _ AH N D _ JH AA L IY .
We all work for nothing. :: W IY _ AO L _ W ER K _ F AO R _ N AH TH IH NG .
It could not be too high. :: IH T _ K UH D _ N AA T _ B IY _ T UW _ HH AY .
The law should be changed. :: DH AH _ L AO _ SH UH D _ B IY _ CH EY N JH D .
We did not have a clue. :: W IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ HH AE V _ AH _ K L UW .
There were few surprises. :: DH EH R _ W ER _ F Y UW _ S ER P R AY Z IH Z .
It is very enjoyable. :: IH T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ EH N JH OY AH B AH L .
He is doing just that. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ D UW IH NG _ JH AH S T _ DH AE T .
But it was no problem. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ N OW _ P R AA B L AH M .
So what is the problem? :: S OW _ W AH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M ?
I've got to get noticed! :: AY V _ G AA T _ T UW _ G EH T _ N OW T AH S T !
Not that it was needed. :: N AA T _ DH AE T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ N IY D AH D .
But he is not hopeful. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ HH OW P F AH L .
We just want them home. :: W IY _ JH AH S T _ W AA N T _ DH EH M _ HH OW M .
The case was continued. :: DH AH _ K EY S _ W AA Z _ K AH N T IH N Y UW D .
He was, but only just. :: HH IY _ W AA Z , B AH T _ OW N L IY _ JH AH S T .
That will be important. :: DH AE T _ W IH L _ B IY _ IH M P AO R T AH N T .
But they are a good team. :: B AH T _ DH EY _ AA R _ AH _ G UH D _ T IY M .
The next game is today. :: DH AH _ N EH K S T _ G EY M _ IH Z _ T AH D EY .
She has never been back. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ N EH V ER _ B IH N _ B AE K .
They are not going away. :: DH EY _ AA R _ N AA T _ G OW IH NG _ AH W EY .
There have been so many. :: DH EH R _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ S OW _ M EH N IY .
She was very different. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ D IH F ER AH N T .
An inquiry has begun. :: AE N _ IH N K W AY R IY _ HH AE Z _ B IH G AH N .
What do you want to say? :: W AH T _ D UW _ Y UW _ W AA N T _ T UW _ S EY ?
Maybe it will work there. :: M EY B IY _ IH T _ W IH L _ W ER K _ DH EH R .
This is actually true. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AE K CH AH W AH L IY _ T R UW .
I see no need to change. :: AY _ S IY _ N OW _ N IY D _ T UW _ CH EY N JH .
I am happy to be here. :: AY _ AE M _ HH AE P IY _ T UW _ B IY _ HH IY R .
There could be a way back. :: DH EH R _ K UH D _ B IY _ AH _ W EY _ B AE K .
It is a terrible place. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ T EH R AH B AH L _ P L EY S .
Our intentions are real. :: AW ER _ IH N T EH N CH AH N Z _ AA R _ R IY L .
We have to move forward. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ M UW V _ F AO R W ER D .
I don't want to use it. :: AY _ D OW N T _ W AA N T _ T UW _ Y UW S _ IH T .
He looks like an Afghan. :: HH IY _ L UH K S _ L AY K _ AE N _ AE F G AE N .
There was no safety net. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ S EY F T IY _ N EH T .
It was never a starter. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N EH V ER _ AH _ S T AA R T ER .
It is difficult to say. :: IH T _ IH Z _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ T UW _ S EY .
The dealer is on notice. :: DH AH _ D IY L ER _ IH Z _ AA N _ N OW T AH S .
Is there a waiting list? :: IH Z _ DH EH R _ AH _ W EY T IH NG _ L IH S T ?
There is no deal as yet. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ D IY L _ AE Z _ Y EH T .
There was a battle there. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ B AE T AH L _ DH EH R .
The post will be unpaid. :: DH AH _ P OW S T _ W IH L _ B IY _ AH N P EY D .
It's the same old story. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ S EY M _ OW L D _ S T AO R IY .
Ferguson should take note. :: F ER G AH S AH N _ SH UH D _ T EY K _ N OW T .
It's certainly different. :: IH T S _ S ER T AH N L IY _ D IH F ER AH N T .
Tiger is the exception. :: T AY G ER _ IH Z _ DH AH _ IH K S EH P SH AH N .
They haven't got a hope. :: DH EY _ HH AE V AH N T _ G AA T _ AH _ HH OW P .
It was a cry for help. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ K R AY _ F AO R _ HH EH L P .
I've lost all confidence. :: AY V _ L AO S T _ AO L _ K AA N F AH D AH N S .
He is on the wrong side. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ R AO NG _ S AY D .
They had to explain it. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ IH K S P L EY N _ IH T .
The Queen Mother is dead. :: DH AH _ K W IY N _ M AH DH ER _ IH Z _ D EH D .
It had all been arranged. :: IH T _ HH AE D _ AO L _ B IH N _ ER EY N JH D .
We accept the new rules. :: W IY _ AE K S EH P T _ DH AH _ N UW _ R UW L Z .
She said they would appeal. :: SH IY _ S EH D _ DH EY _ W UH D _ AH P IY L .
All would be under threat. :: AO L _ W UH D _ B IY _ AH N D ER _ TH R EH T .
People are on the alert. :: P IY P AH L _ AA R _ AA N _ DH AH _ AH L ER T .
The bill would be massive. :: DH AH _ B IH L _ W UH D _ B IY _ M AE S IH V .

We must learn to finish. :: W IY _ M AH S T _ L ER N _ T UW _ F IH N IH SH .

You have to see the work. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ S IY _ DH AH _ W ER K .
I was first in the door. :: AY _ W AA Z _ F ER S T _ IH N _ DH AH _ D AO R .
Maybe they will see sense. :: M EY B IY _ DH EY _ W IH L _ S IY _ S EH N S .
What are you not good at? :: W AH T _ AA R _ Y UW _ N AA T _ G UH D _ AE T ?
She now lives in London. :: SH IY _ N AW _ L IH V Z _ IH N _ L AH N D AH N .
I have to protect them. :: AY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ P R AH T EH K T _ DH EH M .
He dismissed the action. :: HH IY _ D IH S M IH S T _ DH AH _ AE K SH AH N .
The results are tragic. :: DH AH _ R IH Z AH L T S _ AA R _ T R AE JH IH K .
The research was my life. :: DH AH _ R IY S ER CH _ W AA Z _ M AY _ L AY F .
Now the plot is perfect. :: N AW _ DH AH _ P L AA T _ IH Z _ P ER F EH K T .
We should have gone solo. :: W IY _ SH UH D _ HH AE V _ G AO N _ S OW L OW .
I had to win this race. :: AY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ W IH N _ DH IH S _ R EY S .
We started from scratch. :: W IY _ S T AA R T AH D _ F R AH M _ S K R AE CH .
But who was driving it? :: B AH T _ HH UW _ W AA Z _ D R AY V IH NG _ IH T ?
But, of course, it isn't. :: B AH T , AH V _ K AO R S , IH T _ IH Z AH N T .
Bob Dylan's getting old. :: B AA B _ D IH L AH N Z _ G EH T IH NG _ OW L D .
Gilbert was not amused. :: G IH L B ER T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH M Y UW Z D .
And it's more subversive. :: AH N D _ IH T S _ M AO R _ S AH B V ER S IH V .
It worked, up to a point. :: IH T _ W ER K T , AH P _ T UW _ AH _ P OY N T .
I am not a free trader. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ AH _ F R IY _ T R EY D ER .
I don't have a new house. :: AY _ D OW N T _ HH AE V _ AH _ N UW _ HH AW S .
I'm very puzzled by it. :: AY M _ V EH R IY _ P AH Z AH L D _ B AY _ IH T .
I've got a young family. :: AY V _ G AA T _ AH _ Y AH NG _ F AE M AH L IY .
First is open defiance. :: F ER S T _ IH Z _ OW P AH N _ D IH F AY AH N S .
We are not too surprised. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ T UW _ S ER P R AY Z D .
They do the work, you know. :: DH EY _ D UW _ DH AH _ W ER K , Y UW _ N OW .
Other people also tried. :: AH DH ER _ P IY P AH L _ AO L S OW _ T R AY D .
It is not an abortion. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AE N _ AH B AO R SH AH N .
It's a very high number. :: IH T S _ AH _ V EH R IY _ HH AY _ N AH M B ER .
I could do a better job. :: AY _ K UH D _ D UW _ AH _ B EH T ER _ JH AA B .
It may not be life long. :: IH T _ M EY _ N AA T _ B IY _ L AY F _ L AO NG .
Then there's the Old Firm. :: DH EH N _ DH EH R Z _ DH AH _ OW L D _ F ER M .
I am greatly encouraged. :: AY _ AE M _ G R EY T L IY _ EH N K ER IH JH D .
He is a very nice man. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ N AY S _ M AE N .
We want to sort it out. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ S AO R T _ IH T _ AW T .
It's better to be happy. :: IH T S _ B EH T ER _ T UW _ B IY _ HH AE P IY .
Perhaps it is jealousy. :: P ER HH AE P S _ IH T _ IH Z _ JH EH L AH S IY .
He says it often enough. :: HH IY _ S EH Z _ IH T _ AO F AH N _ IH N AH F .
They've got to get better. :: DH EY V _ G AA T _ T UW _ G EH T _ B EH T ER .
We accept the challenge. :: W IY _ AE K S EH P T _ DH AH _ CH AE L AH N JH .
IS Tony Blair on drugs? :: IH Z _ T OW N IY _ B L EH R _ AA N _ D R AH G Z ?
The judge was very nice. :: DH AH _ JH AH JH _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ N AY S .
This series is for real. :: DH IH S _ S IH R IY Z _ IH Z _ F AO R _ R IY L .
She was so full of life. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ S OW _ F UH L _ AH V _ L AY F .
So, how did this happen? :: S OW , HH AW _ D IH D _ DH IH S _ HH AE P AH N ?
The police were called in. :: DH AH _ P AH L IY S _ W ER _ K AO L D _ IH N .
I am awaiting a reply. :: AY _ AE M _ AH W EY T IH NG _ AH _ R IH P L AY .
There's no doubt about it. :: DH EH R Z _ N OW _ D AW T _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
The same goes for Russia. :: DH AH _ S EY M _ G OW Z _ F AO R _ R AH SH AH .
Then there is the terrain. :: DH EH N _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ DH AH _ T ER EY N .
It's always a rehearsal. :: IH T S _ AO L W EY Z _ AH _ R IH HH ER S AH L .
It will be a great night. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ AH _ G R EY T _ N AY T .
He will decide tomorrow. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ D IH S AY D _ T AH M AA R OW .
I am very, very happy. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY , V EH R IY _ HH AE P IY .
There are a few changes. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ AH _ F Y UW _ CH EY N JH AH Z .
This will have to change. :: DH IH S _ W IH L _ HH AE V _ T UW _ CH EY N JH .
That's a matter for them. :: DH AE T S _ AH _ M AE T ER _ F AO R _ DH EH M .
I'll take it as it comes. :: AY L _ T EY K _ IH T _ AE Z _ IH T _ K AH M Z .
It's about taking risks. :: IH T S _ AH B AW T _ T EY K IH NG _ R IH S K S .
We have nothing to lose. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ L UW Z .
I really have to go now. :: AY _ R IH L IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G OW _ N AW .
We have got to the top. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ T UW _ DH AH _ T AA P .
He may have a long wait. :: HH IY _ M EY _ HH AE V _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY T .
You know it was good fun. :: Y UW _ N OW _ IH T _ W AA Z _ G UH D _ F AH N .
It means a huge amount. :: IH T _ M IY N Z _ AH _ HH Y UW JH _ AH M AW N T .
It is a crucial award. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ K R UW SH AH L _ AH W AO R D .
It has been a great day. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ AH _ G R EY T _ D EY .
It almost certainly is. :: IH T _ AO L M OW S T _ S ER T AH N L IY _ IH Z .
It happens in real life. :: IH T _ HH AE P AH N Z _ IH N _ R IY L _ L AY F .
It's a human tragedy. :: IH T S _ AH _ HH Y UW M AH N _ T R AE JH AH D IY .
It's not right of Labour. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ R AY T _ AH V _ L EY B AW R .
Our season is not over. :: AW ER _ S IY Z AH N _ IH Z _ N AA T _ OW V ER .
Who was being affected? :: HH UW _ W AA Z _ B IY IH NG _ AH F EH K T AH D ?
We have had our debate. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ HH AE D _ AW ER _ D AH B EY T .
It can take a long time. :: IH T _ K AE N _ T EY K _ AH _ L AO NG _ T AY M .
It has great potential. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ G R EY T _ P AH T EH N SH AH L .
This decision is folly. :: DH IH S _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ IH Z _ F AA L IY .
I welcome the decision. :: AY _ W EH L K AH M _ DH AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N .
His mother was English. :: HH IH Z _ M AH DH ER _ W AA Z _ IH NG G L IH SH .
He didn't get out much. :: HH IY _ D IH D AH N T _ G EH T _ AW T _ M AH CH .
That had never happened. :: DH AE T _ HH AE D _ N EH V ER _ HH AE P AH N D .
His party never arrived. :: HH IH Z _ P AA R T IY _ N EH V ER _ ER AY V D .
I wanted to have a go. :: AY _ W AA N T AH D _ T UW _ HH AE V _ AH _ G OW .
By then it was too late. :: B AY _ DH EH N _ IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ L EY T .
I think we can do well. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ W IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ W EH L .
He is to be commended. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ T UW _ B IY _ K AH M EH N D IH D .
It is not a soap opera. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ S OW P _ AA P R AH .
The Old Firm are growing. :: DH AH _ OW L D _ F ER M _ AA R _ G R OW IH NG .
He was later deported. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ L EY T ER _ D IH P AO R T AH D .
The statement was a lie. :: DH AH _ S T EY T M AH N T _ W AA Z _ AH _ L AY .
So what is their secret? :: S OW _ W AH T _ IH Z _ DH EH R _ S IY K R AH T ?
That is bound to happen. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ B AW N D _ T UW _ HH AE P AH N .
It is good for our team. :: IH T _ IH Z _ G UH D _ F AO R _ AW ER _ T IY M .
I had a fortunate war. :: AY _ HH AE D _ AH _ F AO R CH AH N AH T _ W AO R .
What are you not good at? :: W AH T _ AA R _ Y UW _ N AA T _ G UH D _ AE T ?
She failed in her action. :: SH IY _ F EY L D _ IH N _ HH ER _ AE K SH AH N .
Have a look at this lot. :: HH AE V _ AH _ L UH K _ AE T _ DH IH S _ L AA T .
It was forced to divert. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ F AO R S T _ T UW _ D AY V ER T .
I'm delighted about that. :: AY M _ D IH L AY T AH D _ AH B AW T _ DH AE T .
Indeed, it was magical. :: IH N D IY D , IH T _ W AA Z _ M AE JH IH K AH L .
None has ever been found. :: N AH N _ HH AE Z _ EH V ER _ B IH N _ F AW N D .
My goal is quite simple. :: M AY _ G OW L _ IH Z _ K W AY T _ S IH M P AH L .
Then again, we could have. :: DH EH N _ AH G EH N , W IY _ K UH D _ HH AE V .
But we finished the show. :: B AH T _ W IY _ F IH N IH SH T _ DH AH _ SH OW .
We shall not forget him. :: W IY _ SH AE L _ N AA T _ F ER G EH T _ HH IH M .
It was clear on Thursday. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K L IH R _ AA N _ TH ER Z D EY .
Blair's response was weak. :: B L EH R Z _ R IH S P AA N S _ W AA Z _ W IY K .
I can lead by example. :: AY _ K AE N _ L EH D _ B AY _ IH G Z AE M P AH L .
That is all in the past. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AO L _ IH N _ DH AH _ P AE S T .
They should be swept away. :: DH EY _ SH UH D _ B IY _ S W EH P T _ AH W EY .
They have to be addressed. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ B IY _ AH D R EH S T .
He works at the airport. :: HH IY _ W ER K S _ AE T _ DH AH _ EH R P AO R T .
It was a big departure. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ B IH G _ D IH P AA R CH ER .
You are a gambling man. :: Y UW _ AA R _ AH _ G AE M B AH L IH NG _ M AE N .
It's perfectly feasible. :: IH T S _ P ER F AH K T L IY _ F IY Z AH B AH L .
Hard cash is needed now. :: HH AA R D _ K AE SH _ IH Z _ N IY D AH D _ N AW .
I haven't got there yet. :: AY _ HH AE V AH N T _ G AA T _ DH EH R _ Y EH T .
We have got to deliver. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ T UW _ D IH L IH V ER .
There is a lack of staff. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ L AE K _ AH V _ S T AE F .
He is already in place. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AO L R EH D IY _ IH N _ P L EY S .
He is a great prospect. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ P R AA S P EH K T .
Of course I was tempted. :: AH V _ K AO R S _ AY _ W AA Z _ T EH M P T AH D .
It is so very obvious. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S OW _ V EH R IY _ AA B V IY AH S .
And huge, indeed, it is. :: AH N D _ HH Y UW JH , IH N D IY D , IH T _ IH Z .
Nothing was meant by it. :: N AH TH IH NG _ W AA Z _ M EH N T _ B AY _ IH T .
It's the same as Glasgow. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ S EY M _ AE Z _ G L AE S K OW .
We will not tolerate it. :: W IY _ W IH L _ N AA T _ T AA L ER EY T _ IH T .
Brian was last to join. :: B R AY AH N _ W AA Z _ L AE S T _ T UW _ JH OY N .
We have several options. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ S EH V R AH L _ AA P SH AH N Z .
So we kept them waiting. :: S OW _ W IY _ K EH P T _ DH EH M _ W EY T IH NG .
The funding is now there. :: DH AH _ F AH N D IH NG _ IH Z _ N AW _ DH EH R .
I was embarrassed by it. :: AY _ W AA Z _ IH M B EH R AH S T _ B AY _ IH T .
You're quite wrong, he said. :: Y UH R _ K W AY T _ R AO NG , HH IY _ S EH D .
Is it in the right place? :: IH Z _ IH T _ IH N _ DH AH _ R AY T _ P L EY S ?
She runs like her mother. :: SH IY _ R AH N Z _ L AY K _ HH ER _ M AH DH ER .
It was men against boys. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ M EH N _ AH G EH N S T _ B OY Z .
He had played very well. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ P L EY D _ V EH R IY _ W EH L .
That is for white people. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ F AO R _ W AY T _ P IY P AH L .
The people are nice, though. :: DH AH _ P IY P AH L _ AA R _ N AY S , DH OW .
So I liked the challenge. :: S OW _ AY _ L AY K T _ DH AH _ CH AE L AH N JH .
He wants to talk a lot. :: HH IY _ W AA N T S _ T UW _ T AO K _ AH _ L AA T .
They need to be involved. :: DH EY _ N IY D _ T UW _ B IY _ IH N V AA L V D .
It's like a football team. :: IH T S _ L AY K _ AH _ F UH T B AO L _ T IY M .
It is not in my nature. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ IH N _ M AY _ N EY CH ER .
Everything has collapsed. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ HH AE Z _ K AH L AE P S T .
The men are very worried. :: DH AH _ M EH N _ AA R _ V EH R IY _ W ER IY D .
I could not live with it. :: AY _ K UH D _ N AA T _ L AY V _ W IH DH _ IH T .
That was six years ago. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ S IH K S _ Y IH R Z _ AH G OW .
This is his first movie. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ HH IH Z _ F ER S T _ M UW V IY .
They are in good spirits. :: DH EY _ AA R _ IH N _ G UH D _ S P IH R AH T S .
And does it even matter? :: AH N D _ D AH Z _ IH T _ IY V IH N _ M AE T ER ?
Sub Not Used, McCormick. :: S AH B _ N AA T _ Y UW Z D , M AH K AO R M IH K .
Four had been brought down. :: F AO R _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ B R AO T _ D AW N .
We are the weakest link. :: W IY _ AA R _ DH AH _ W IY K AH S T _ L IH NG K .
You can't get a mortgage. :: Y UW _ K AE N T _ G EH T _ AH _ M AO R G AH JH .
The appeal is impartial. :: DH AH _ AH P IY L _ IH Z _ IH M P AA R SH AH L .
Such debate is pointless. :: S AH CH _ D AH B EY T _ IH Z _ P OY N T L AH S .
He's right up to a point. :: HH IY Z _ R AY T _ AH P _ T UW _ AH _ P OY N T .
We meet again in Berlin. :: W IY _ M IY T _ AH G EH N _ IH N _ B ER L IH N .
Who do you think you are? :: HH UW _ D UW _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K _ Y UW _ AA R ?
There is no smoking gun. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ S M OW K IH NG _ G AH N .
I asked why he had come. :: AY _ AE S K T _ W AY _ HH IY _ HH AE D _ K AH M .
I learned a lot from her. :: AY _ L ER N D _ AH _ L AA T _ F R AH M _ HH ER .
I am proud of those guys. :: AY _ AE M _ P R AW D _ AH V _ DH OW Z _ G AY Z .
They were both very brave. :: DH EY _ W ER _ B OW TH _ V EH R IY _ B R EY V .
Are his works inside out? :: AA R _ HH IH Z _ W ER K S _ IH N S AY D _ AW T ?
Why did they let him go? :: W AY _ D IH D _ DH EY _ L EH T _ HH IH M _ G OW ?
We said, What do you mean? :: W IY _ S EH D , W AH T _ D UW _ Y UW _ M IY N ?
I tend not to look back. :: AY _ T EH N D _ N AA T _ T UW _ L UH K _ B AE K .
That got me out of jail. :: DH AE T _ G AA T _ M IY _ AW T _ AH V _ JH EY L .
I will wait until later. :: AY _ W IH L _ W EY T _ AH N T IH L _ L EY T ER .
Nor should there have been. :: N AO R _ SH UH D _ DH EH R _ HH AE V _ B IH N .
Changes need to be made. :: CH EY N JH AH Z _ N IY D _ T UW _ B IY _ M EY D .
She is a double victim. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ D AH B AH L _ V IH K T AH M .
The love affair was over. :: DH AH _ L AH V _ AH F EH R _ W AA Z _ OW V ER .
I tend to not look back. :: AY _ T EH N D _ T UW _ N AA T _ L UH K _ B AE K .
Is that too much to ask? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ T UW _ M AH CH _ T UW _ AE S K ?
I think it's a disgrace. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T S _ AH _ D IH S G R EY S .
Was it just negligent. :: W AA Z _ IH T _ JH AH S T _ N EH G L AH JH AH N T .
Gordon Brown was superb. :: G AO R D AH N _ B R AW N _ W AA Z _ S UH P ER B .
They hit me in the head. :: DH EY _ HH IH T _ M IY _ IH N _ DH AH _ HH EH D .
There is nothing to fear. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ F IH R .
Or so everyone believed. :: AO R _ S OW _ EH V R IY W AH N _ B IH L IY V D .
You name it, they have it. :: Y UW _ N EY M _ IH T , DH EY _ HH AE V _ IH T .
Have we tried everything? :: HH AE V _ W IY _ T R AY D _ EH V R IY TH IH NG ?
What a week he has had. :: W AH T _ AH _ W IY K _ HH IY _ HH AE Z _ HH AE D .
I kept it very simple. :: AY _ K EH P T _ IH T _ V EH R IY _ S IH M P AH L .
The rest was badminton. :: DH AH _ R EH S T _ W AA Z _ B AE D M IH N T AH N .
That happens in boxing. :: DH AE T _ HH AE P AH N Z _ IH N _ B AA K S IH NG .
Italy would be lukewarm. :: IH T AH L IY _ W UH D _ B IY _ L UW K W AO R M .
The problem is the book. :: DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M _ IH Z _ DH AH _ B UH K .
I am so lucky for that. :: AY _ AE M _ S OW _ L AH K IY _ F AO R _ DH AE T .
These things just happen. :: DH IY Z _ TH IH NG Z _ JH AH S T _ HH AE P AH N .
Maybe his time has gone. :: M EY B IY _ HH IH Z _ T AY M _ HH AE Z _ G AO N .
We have nothing to hide. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ HH AY D .
It is in our own hands. :: IH T _ IH Z _ IH N _ AW ER _ OW N _ HH AE N D Z .
It's a sign of the times. :: IH T S _ AH _ S AY N _ AH V _ DH AH _ T AY M Z .
I'm delighted for Simon. :: AY M _ D IH L AY T AH D _ F AO R _ S AY M AH N .
I won't let that happen. :: AY _ W OW N T _ L EH T _ DH AE T _ HH AE P AH N .
But there was everything! :: B AH T _ DH EH R _ W AA Z _ EH V R IY TH IH NG !
We were extremely lucky. :: W IY _ W ER _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ L AH K IY .
It was an amazing time. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ AH M EY Z IH NG _ T AY M .
But do not rely on it. :: B AH T _ D UW _ N AA T _ R IH L AY _ AA N _ IH T .
This is a new beginning. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ N UW _ B IH G IH N IH NG .
This was not a contest. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH _ K AA N T EH S T .
It really is tremendous. :: IH T _ R IH L IY _ IH Z _ T R AH M EH N D AH S .
She is deeply distressed. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ D IY P L IY _ D IH S T R EH S T .
We are at the crossroads. :: W IY _ AA R _ AE T _ DH AH _ K R AO S R OW D Z .
He's got the same story. :: HH IY Z _ G AA T _ DH AH _ S EY M _ S T AO R IY .
The latter way is my way. :: DH AH _ L AE T ER _ W EY _ IH Z _ M AY _ W EY .
Everyone believes in it. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ B IH L IY V Z _ IH N _ IH T .
I believe in the Union. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ DH AH _ Y UW N Y AH N .
No one would believe him. :: N OW _ W AH N _ W UH D _ B IH L IY V _ HH IH M .
This is bound to happen. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ B AW N D _ T UW _ HH AE P AH N .
We can't win a big game. :: W IY _ K AE N T _ W IH N _ AH _ B IH G _ G EY M .
It was the train coming. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ T R EY N _ K AH M IH NG .
I was pleased about that. :: AY _ W AA Z _ P L IY Z D _ AH B AW T _ DH AE T .
It's a creative energy. :: IH T S _ AH _ K R IY EY T IH V _ EH N ER JH IY .
It is part of his game. :: IH T _ IH Z _ P AA R T _ AH V _ HH IH Z _ G EY M .
Well, that's all right then. :: W EH L , DH AE T S _ AO L _ R AY T _ DH EH N .
I found that we couldn't. :: AY _ F AW N D _ DH AE T _ W IY _ K UH D AH N T .
They continue to do so. :: DH EY _ K AH N T IH N Y UW _ T UW _ D UW _ S OW .
It's somewhere in between. :: IH T S _ S AH M W EH R _ IH N _ B IH T W IY N .
Ours is on for two days. :: AW ER Z _ IH Z _ AA N _ F AO R _ T UW _ D EY Z .
Gritty he did not want. :: G R IH T IY _ HH IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ W AA N T .
I didn't have the choice. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ CH OY S .
So it was in politics. :: S OW _ IH T _ W AA Z _ IH N _ P AA L AH T IH K S .
Thankfully they liked it. :: TH AE NG K F AH L IY _ DH EY _ L AY K T _ IH T .
It had happened to him. :: IH T _ HH AE D _ HH AE P AH N D _ T UW _ HH IH M .
It is a common problem. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ K AA M AH N _ P R AA B L AH M .
Well, you can have a tree. :: W EH L , Y UW _ K AE N _ HH AE V _ AH _ T R IY .
We are a peaceful people. :: W IY _ AA R _ AH _ P IY S F AH L _ P IY P AH L .
It's a matter of balance. :: IH T S _ AH _ M AE T ER _ AH V _ B AE L AH N S .
Tommy is not a problem. :: T AA M IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
The people are the hero. :: DH AH _ P IY P AH L _ AA R _ DH AH _ HH IH R OW .
I think it's a good sign. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T S _ AH _ G UH D _ S AY N .
It's just a normal life. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ AH _ N AO R M AH L _ L AY F .
She took them for a term. :: SH IY _ T UH K _ DH EH M _ F AO R _ AH _ T ER M .
Is it in the right place? :: IH Z _ IH T _ IH N _ DH AH _ R AY T _ P L EY S ?
The judge was really nice. :: DH AH _ JH AH JH _ W AA Z _ R IH L IY _ N AY S .
Nothing is yet confirmed. :: N AH TH IH NG _ IH Z _ Y EH T _ K AH N F ER M D .
I was in daily contact. :: AY _ W AA Z _ IH N _ D EY L IY _ K AA N T AE K T .
We knew nothing about it. :: W IY _ N UW _ N AH TH IH NG _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
He is slightly confused. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ S L AY T L IY _ K AH N F Y UW Z D .
I was happily surprised. :: AY _ W AA Z _ HH AE P AH L IY _ S ER P R AY Z D .
Everything was an effort. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ W AA Z _ AE N _ EH F ER T .
It was fit for royalty. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ F IH T _ F AO R _ R OY AH L T IY .
They said she was stable. :: DH EY _ S EH D _ SH IY _ W AA Z _ S T EY B AH L .
The opposite is the case. :: DH AH _ AA P AH Z AH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K EY S .
It has to be an event. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ B IY _ AE N _ IH V EH N T .
She has left the island. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ L EH F T _ DH AH _ AY L AH N D .

It was to be inclusive. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ B IY _ IH N K L UW S IH V .
Today is not a victory. :: T AH D EY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ V IH K T ER IY .
No one wants a dispute. :: N OW _ W AH N _ W AA N T S _ AH _ D IH S P Y UW T .
I am extremely cautious. :: AY _ AE M _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ K AO SH AH S .
It's just the way I play. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ DH AH _ W EY _ AY _ P L EY .

It left me with sadness. :: IH T _ L EH F T _ M IY _ W IH DH _ S AE D N AH S .
The failings are serious. :: DH AH _ F EY L IH NG Z _ AA R _ S IH R IY AH S .
It is like a bereavement. :: IH T _ IH Z _ L AY K _ AH _ B ER IY V M AH N T .
They were not up to speed. :: DH EY _ W ER _ N AA T _ AH P _ T UW _ S P IY D .
How well did they get on? :: HH AW _ W EH L _ D IH D _ DH EY _ G EH T _ AA N ?
I'm the one that said it. :: AY M _ DH AH _ W AH N _ DH AE T _ S EH D _ IH T .

That's interesting to me. :: DH AE T S _ IH N T R AH S T IH NG _ T UW _ M IY .
I didn't understand it. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ IH T .
It is a traffic warden. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ T R AE F IH K _ W AO R D AH N .
It plainly does not work. :: IH T _ P L EY N L IY _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ W ER K .
They had seven children. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ S EH V AH N _ CH IH L D R AH N .
It was too close to call. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ K L OW S _ T UW _ K AO L .
There is ample evidence. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AE M P AH L _ EH V AH D AH N S .
The voters rejected us. :: DH AH _ V OW T ER Z _ R IH JH EH K T IH D _ AH S .
There is much work to do. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ M AH CH _ W ER K _ T UW _ D UW .
Nobody else is at risk. :: N OW B AA D IY _ EH L S _ IH Z _ AE T _ R IH S K .
Which is where we come in. :: W IH CH _ IH Z _ W EH R _ W IY _ K AH M _ IH N .
But it is being pursued. :: B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ B IY IH NG _ P ER S UW D .
We have been here before. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ HH IY R _ B IH F AO R .
Sadly, it is not to be. :: S AE D L IY , IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ T UW _ B IY .

I don't feel like working. :: AY _ D OW N T _ F IY L _ L AY K _ W ER K IH NG .
Then one day it happened. :: DH EH N _ W AH N _ D EY _ IH T _ HH AE P AH N D .
It seems to go down well. :: IH T _ S IY M Z _ T UW _ G OW _ D AW N _ W EH L .
No-one has spoken to me. :: _ N UW N _ HH AE Z _ S P OW K AH N _ T UW _ M IY .

The irony was not lost. :: DH AH _ AY R AH N IY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ L AO S T .
Government will intervene. :: G AH V ER M AH N T _ W IH L _ IH N T ER V IY N .
This is a central issue. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ S EH N T R AH L _ IH SH UW .
I can't wait to meet him. :: AY _ K AE N T _ W EY T _ T UW _ M IY T _ HH IH M .
They were the acts of men. :: DH EY _ W ER _ DH AH _ AE K T S _ AH V _ M EH N .
The problem is the pitch. :: DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M _ IH Z _ DH AH _ P IH CH .
My whole life has changed. :: M AY _ HH OW L _ L AY F _ HH AE Z _ CH EY N JH D .
This is a friendly match? :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ F R EH N D L IY _ M AE CH ?
But it is all by design. :: B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ AO L _ B AY _ D IH Z AY N .
They were behind the wheel. :: DH EY _ W ER _ B IH HH AY N D _ DH AH _ W IY L .
Phase one was a shambles. :: F EY Z _ W AH N _ W AA Z _ AH _ SH AE M B AH L Z .
I made a terrible start. :: AY _ M EY D _ AH _ T EH R AH B AH L _ S T AA R T .
My life is in the ballet. :: M AY _ L AY F _ IH Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ B AE L EY .
I have a moral dilemma. :: AY _ HH AE V _ AH _ M AO R AH L _ D IH L EH M AH .
You will not feel a thing. :: Y UW _ W IH L _ N AA T _ F IY L _ AH _ TH IH NG .
Anyone can do the sums. :: EH N IY W AH N _ K AE N _ D UW _ DH AH _ S AH M Z .
We are a new department. :: W IY _ AA R _ AH _ N UW _ D IH P AA R T M AH N T .
Which isn't a bad idea. :: W IH CH _ IH Z AH N T _ AH _ B AE D _ AY D IY AH .
The concerns are the same. :: DH AH _ K AH N S ER N Z _ AA R _ DH AH _ S EY M .
Driving has been the key. :: D R AY V IH NG _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ DH AH _ K IY .
We're looking for justice. :: W IY R _ L UH K IH NG _ F AO R _ JH AH S T AH S .
But we will have to wait. :: B AH T _ W IY _ W IH L _ HH AE V _ T UW _ W EY T .
He was in his element. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ IH N _ HH IH Z _ EH L AH M AH N T .
Is our children learning? :: IH Z _ AW ER _ CH IH L D R AH N _ L ER N IH NG ?
We have turned the corner. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T ER N D _ DH AH _ K AO R N ER .
Our house was very small. :: AW ER _ HH AW S _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ S M AO L .
The result is a vacuum. :: DH AH _ R IH Z AH L T _ IH Z _ AH _ V AE K Y UW M .
Before it was an ordeal. :: B IH F AO R _ IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ AO R D IY L .
It looked like a war zone. :: IH T _ L UH K T _ L AY K _ AH _ W AO R _ Z OW N .
And so was a photograph. :: AH N D _ S OW _ W AA Z _ AH _ F OW T AH G R AE F .
I remember that day well. :: AY _ R IH M EH M B ER _ DH AE T _ D EY _ W EH L .
This is a step backwards. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ S T EH P _ B AE K W ER D Z .
You just have to accept. :: Y UW _ JH AH S T _ HH AE V _ T UW _ AE K S EH P T .
Mr Blair had done well. :: M IH S T ER _ B L EH R _ HH AE D _ D AH N _ W EH L .
But nothing could be done. :: B AH T _ N AH TH IH NG _ K UH D _ B IY _ D AH N .
It was like the old days. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ L AY K _ DH AH _ OW L D _ D EY Z .
I'm pleased with the horse. :: AY M _ P L IY Z D _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ HH AO R S .
I have been very nervous. :: AY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ V EH R IY _ N ER V AH S .
He is a quality player. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ K W AA L AH T IY _ P L EY ER .
Bombing slaughter rejected :: B AA M IH NG _ S L AO T ER _ R IH JH EH K T IH D
No Briton has ever won. :: N OW _ B R IH T AH N _ HH AE Z _ EH V ER _ W AH N .
The party is up for it. :: DH AH _ P AA R T IY _ IH Z _ AH P _ F AO R _ IH T .
There is no hiding place. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ HH AY D IH NG _ P L EY S .
She will attend in July. :: SH IY _ W IH L _ AH T EH N D _ IH N _ JH UW L AY .
It was a total surprise. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ T OW T AH L _ S ER P R AY Z .
Chelsea was a great club. :: CH EH L S IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ K L AH B .
They will form a tribute. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ F AO R M _ AH _ T R IH B Y UW T .
I'm so grateful for that. :: AY M _ S OW _ G R EY T F AH L _ F AO R _ DH AE T .
That is very important. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ IH M P AO R T AH N T .
Now it was Britain's turn. :: N AW _ IH T _ W AA Z _ B R IH T AH N Z _ T ER N .
They like big name players. :: DH EY _ L AY K _ B IH G _ N EY M _ P L EY ER Z .
That goes back a long way. :: DH AE T _ G OW Z _ B AE K _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY .
It needs to be volatile. :: IH T _ N IY D Z _ T UW _ B IY _ V AA L AH T AH L .
It's as we were yesterday. :: IH T S _ AE Z _ W IY _ W ER _ Y EH S T ER D EY .
Of course, it is nonsense. :: AH V _ K AO R S , IH T _ IH Z _ N AA N S EH N S .
Who will provide the wine? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ P R AH V AY D _ DH AH _ W AY N ?
I've always been like that. :: AY V _ AO L W EY Z _ B IH N _ L AY K _ DH AE T .
He looked like a schoolboy. :: HH IY _ L UH K T _ L AY K _ AH _ S K UW L B OY .
The damage has been done. :: DH AH _ D AE M AH JH _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ D AH N .
I have signed a contract. :: AY _ HH AE V _ S AY N D _ AH _ K AA N T R AE K T .
It is a disaster area. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ D IH Z AE S T ER _ EH R IY AH .
Five officers were injured. :: F AY V _ AO F AH S ER Z _ W ER _ IH N JH ER D .
It's a technical demand. :: IH T S _ AH _ T EH K N IH K AH L _ D IH M AE N D .
It has made me feel good. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ M EY D _ M IY _ F IY L _ G UH D .
I thought he was terrific. :: AY _ TH AO T _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ T ER IH F IH K .
I'm sure he would love it. :: AY M _ SH UH R _ HH IY _ W UH D _ L AH V _ IH T .
We were short of athletes. :: W IY _ W ER _ SH AO R T _ AH V _ AE TH L IY T S .
That's hard for a woman. :: DH AE T S _ HH AA R D _ F AO R _ AH _ W UH M AH N .
My heart is not so sure. :: M AY _ HH AA R T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ S OW _ SH UH R .
All kinds of things occur. :: AO L _ K AY N D Z _ AH V _ TH IH NG Z _ AH K ER .
And that was the adults. :: AH N D _ DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ AH D AH L T S .
He had a heart problem. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ HH AA R T _ P R AA B L AH M .
That was the light relief. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ L AY T _ R IH L IY F .
What makes a house a home? :: W AH T _ M EY K S _ AH _ HH AW S _ AH _ HH OW M ?
The fans will support us. :: DH AH _ F AE N Z _ W IH L _ S AH P AO R T _ AH S .
There is a lot of anger. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ AE NG G ER .
I'll take what comes along. :: AY L _ T EY K _ W AH T _ K AH M Z _ AH L AO NG .
It's just gotten too big. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ G AA T AH N _ T UW _ B IH G .
It need not be like that. :: IH T _ N IY D _ N AA T _ B IY _ L AY K _ DH AE T .
There is no answer to it. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ AE N S ER _ T UW _ IH T .
His name is Michael Owen. :: HH IH Z _ N EY M _ IH Z _ M AY K AH L _ OW AH N .
The snipers are also out. :: DH AH _ S N AY P ER Z _ AA R _ AO L S OW _ AW T .
No details were disclosed. :: N OW _ D IH T EY L Z _ W ER _ D IH S K L OW Z D .

The director's a genius. :: DH AH _ D AY R EH K T ER Z _ AH _ JH IY N Y AH S .
This is not out of choice. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AW T _ AH V _ CH OY S .
This was a chilling echo. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ AH _ CH IH L IH NG _ EH K OW .
I was proud of our lads. :: AY _ W AA Z _ P R AW D _ AH V _ AW ER _ L AE D Z .
We are very nearly there. :: W IY _ AA R _ V EH R IY _ N IH R L IY _ DH EH R .
She died later on Monday. :: SH IY _ D AY D _ L EY T ER _ AA N _ M AH N D IY .
Her role in it was small. :: HH ER _ R OW L _ IH N _ IH T _ W AA Z _ S M AO L .
That's the National Grid. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ N AE SH AH N AH L _ G R IH D .
It was a stunning strike. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ S T AH N IH NG _ S T R AY K .
Why should he go anywhere? :: W AY _ SH UH D _ HH IY _ G OW _ EH N IY W EH R ?
The odds are that it will. :: DH AH _ AA D Z _ AA R _ DH AE T _ IH T _ W IH L .
It will take several days. :: IH T _ W IH L _ T EY K _ S EH V R AH L _ D EY Z .
It's great news, isn't it. :: IH T S _ G R EY T _ N UW Z , IH Z AH N T _ IH T .
That would end it for us. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ EH N D _ IH T _ F AO R _ AH S .
There are no quick fixes. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ N OW _ K W IH K _ F IH K S IH Z .
But don't worry just yet. :: B AH T _ D OW N T _ W ER IY _ JH AH S T _ Y EH T .
They may have been murdered. :: DH EY _ M EY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ M ER D ER D .
I'll have to work on that. :: AY L _ HH AE V _ T UW _ W ER K _ AA N _ DH AE T .
I was very, very happy. :: AY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY , V EH R IY _ HH AE P IY .
Now it has been eclipsed. :: N AW _ IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ IH K L IH P S T .
It was totally my fault. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T OW T AH L IY _ M AY _ F AO L T .
He would take up the bike. :: HH IY _ W UH D _ T EY K _ AH P _ DH AH _ B AY K .
Because he usually is. :: B IH K AO Z _ HH IY _ Y UW ZH AH W AH L IY _ IH Z .
I am not that sadistic. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ DH AE T _ S AH D IH S T IH K .
But they were true stories. :: B AH T _ DH EY _ W ER _ T R UW _ S T AO R IY Z .
There is no other option. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ AH DH ER _ AA P SH AH N .
He said he never saw it. :: HH IY _ S EH D _ HH IY _ N EH V ER _ S AO _ IH T .
He didn't bother a soul. :: HH IY _ D IH D AH N T _ B AA DH ER _ AH _ S OW L .
Her heart was not in it. :: HH ER _ HH AA R T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ IH N _ IH T .
I've already got them in. :: AY V _ AO L R EH D IY _ G AA T _ DH EH M _ IH N .
We've all been here before. :: W IY V _ AO L _ B IH N _ HH IY R _ B IH F AO R .
There is always the smell. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AO L W EY Z _ DH AH _ S M EH L .
But it won't be the same. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W OW N T _ B IY _ DH AH _ S EY M .
They were not missing much. :: DH EY _ W ER _ N AA T _ M IH S IH NG _ M AH CH .
It has made a difference. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ M EY D _ AH _ D IH F ER AH N S .
That depends on Rangers. :: DH AE T _ D IH P EH N D Z _ AA N _ R EY N JH ER Z .
It's not been a good year. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ B IH N _ AH _ G UH D _ Y IH R .
This has been carried out. :: DH IH S _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ K AE R IY D _ AW T .
I believe it will happen. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ IH T _ W IH L _ HH AE P AH N .
Something has to be done. :: S AH M TH IH NG _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ B IY _ D AH N .
Music is all consuming. :: M Y UW Z IH K _ IH Z _ AO L _ K AH N S UW M IH NG .
And it was great for me. :: AH N D _ IH T _ W AA Z _ G R EY T _ F AO R _ M IY .
We can't go on like this. :: W IY _ K AE N T _ G OW _ AA N _ L AY K _ DH IH S .
I will never forget that. :: AY _ W IH L _ N EH V ER _ F ER G EH T _ DH AE T .
That was only the start. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ OW N L IY _ DH AH _ S T AA R T .
Hasn't let anyone down? :: HH AE Z AH N T _ L EH T _ EH N IY W AH N _ D AW N ?
I thought he was at fault. :: AY _ TH AO T _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ AE T _ F AO L T .
I don't see any problem. :: AY _ D OW N T _ S IY _ EH N IY _ P R AA B L AH M .
Is that what people want? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ W AH T _ P IY P AH L _ W AA N T ?
He did that last Sunday. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ DH AE T _ L AE S T _ S AH N D EY .
These people are helpless. :: DH IY Z _ P IY P AH L _ AA R _ HH EH L P L AH S .
And the other winners are. :: AH N D _ DH AH _ AH DH ER _ W IH N ER Z _ AA R .
This is a horrible loss. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ HH AO R AH B AH L _ L AO S .
It is part of their job. :: IH T _ IH Z _ P AA R T _ AH V _ DH EH R _ JH AA B .
This time, it was not be. :: DH IH S _ T AY M , IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ B IY .
This has been fantastic. :: DH IH S _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ F AE N T AE S T IH K .
We just have to improve. :: W IY _ JH AH S T _ HH AE V _ T UW _ IH M P R UW V .
It was something special. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S AH M TH IH NG _ S P EH SH AH L .
It was really surprising. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ R IH L IY _ S ER P R AY Z IH NG .
I've seen it work already. :: AY V _ S IY N _ IH T _ W ER K _ AO L R EH D IY .
It was a sickening sight. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ S IH K AH N IH NG _ S AY T .
People will ask about us. :: P IY P AH L _ W IH L _ AE S K _ AH B AW T _ AH S .
I can hardly believe it. :: AY _ K AE N _ HH AA R D L IY _ B IH L IY V _ IH T .
There's still a bit to go. :: DH EH R Z _ S T IH L _ AH _ B IH T _ T UW _ G OW .
It is safe in our hands. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S EY F _ IH N _ AW ER _ HH AE N D Z .
He was in great spirits. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ IH N _ G R EY T _ S P IH R AH T S .
I guess I was lucky, though. :: AY _ G EH S _ AY _ W AA Z _ L AH K IY , DH OW .
It was never a free kick. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N EH V ER _ AH _ F R IY _ K IH K .
That's not like us at all. :: DH AE T S _ N AA T _ L AY K _ AH S _ AE T _ AO L .
We were a load of rubbish. :: W IY _ W ER _ AH _ L OW D _ AH V _ R AH B IH SH .
If not, he should go home. :: IH F _ N AA T , HH IY _ SH UH D _ G OW _ HH OW M .
There were no casualties. :: DH EH R _ W ER _ N OW _ K AE ZH AH W AH L T IY Z .
She was also very brave. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ AO L S OW _ V EH R IY _ B R EY V .

Are you watching Liverpool? :: AA R _ Y UW _ W AA CH IH NG _ L IH V ER P UW L ?

They are there to help us. :: DH EY _ AA R _ DH EH R _ T UW _ HH EH L P _ AH S .
It was a bit of a shock. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ B IH T _ AH V _ AH _ SH AA K .
This is perfectly legal. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ P ER F AH K T L IY _ L IY G AH L .
I learned a lot from that. :: AY _ L ER N D _ AH _ L AA T _ F R AH M _ DH AE T .

He confirmed his fitness. :: HH IY _ K AH N F ER M D _ HH IH Z _ F IH T N AH S .
Is that such a bad thing? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ S AH CH _ AH _ B AE D _ TH IH NG ?
It was a good atmosphere. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G UH D _ AE T M AH S F IH R .
She was totally possessed. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ T OW T AH L IY _ P AH Z EH S T .
So what is it with Nato? :: S OW _ W AH T _ IH Z _ IH T _ W IH DH _ N EY T OW ?
It is a step on the way. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ S T EH P _ AA N _ DH AH _ W EY .
So far they have refused. :: S OW _ F AA R _ DH EY _ HH AE V _ R AH F Y UW Z D .
It was certainly intense. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S ER T AH N L IY _ IH N T EH N S .
It was complete nonsense. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K AH M P L IY T _ N AA N S EH N S .
We have to work together. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ W ER K _ T AH G EH DH ER .
But that's another story. :: B AH T _ DH AE T S _ AH N AH DH ER _ S T AO R IY .
They have learned from that. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ L ER N D _ F R AH M _ DH AE T .

They were all on a mission. :: DH EY _ W ER _ AO L _ AA N _ AH _ M IH SH AH N .
But it didn't bother me. :: B AH T _ IH T _ D IH D AH N T _ B AA DH ER _ M IY .
You can blame the defence. :: Y UW _ K AE N _ B L EY M _ DH AH _ D IH F EH N S .
It's been very difficult. :: IH T S _ B IH N _ V EH R IY _ D IH F AH K AH L T .
Do something that we need. :: D UW _ S AH M TH IH NG _ DH AE T _ W IY _ N IY D .
He is not the only one. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ OW N L IY _ W AH N .
It's just not good enough. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ N AA T _ G UH D _ IH N AH F .

They are a very good team. :: DH EY _ AA R _ AH _ V EH R IY _ G UH D _ T IY M .
He gave no other details. :: HH IY _ G EY V _ N OW _ AH DH ER _ D IH T EY L Z .
It was that kind of war. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AE T _ K AY N D _ AH V _ W AO R .
It can be very worrying. :: IH T _ K AE N _ B IY _ V EH R IY _ W ER IY IH NG .
I have been very stupid. :: AY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ V EH R IY _ S T UW P AH D .
I can do this on my own. :: AY _ K AE N _ D UW _ DH IH S _ AA N _ M AY _ OW N .

I am really, really happy. :: AY _ AE M _ R IH L IY , R IH L IY _ HH AE P IY .
They were very responsive. :: DH EY _ W ER _ V EH R IY _ R IH S P AA N S IH V .
This time it is official. :: DH IH S _ T AY M _ IH T _ IH Z _ AH F IH SH AH L .
It was a matter of choice. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ M AE T ER _ AH V _ CH OY S .
Nobody did in those days. :: N OW B AA D IY _ D IH D _ IH N _ DH OW Z _ D EY Z .
She's got to say something. :: SH IY Z _ G AA T _ T UW _ S EY _ S AH M TH IH NG .
His third goal was superb. :: HH IH Z _ TH ER D _ G OW L _ W AA Z _ S UH P ER B .

You know the sort of thing. :: Y UW _ N OW _ DH AH _ S AO R T _ AH V _ TH IH NG .
She has so much to offer. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ S OW _ M AH CH _ T UW _ AO F ER .
They showed a lot of heart. :: DH EY _ SH OW D _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ HH AA R T .
We should not be surprised. :: W IY _ SH UH D _ N AA T _ B IY _ S ER P R AY Z D .
That view has not altered. :: DH AE T _ V Y UW _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ AO L T ER D .
It was that bad, that low. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AE T _ B AE D , DH AE T _ L OW .
He has become a monster. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ B IH K AH M _ AH _ M AA N S T ER .
I was always in control. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AO L W EY Z _ IH N _ K AH N T R OW L .
It's not a lack of effort. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ L AE K _ AH V _ EH F ER T .
I didn't have the reply. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ R IH P L AY .
It is tough, but possible. :: IH T _ IH Z _ T AH F , B AH T _ P AA S AH B AH L .
He will be kept informed. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ B IY _ K EH P T _ IH N F AO R M D .
They exist in name alone. :: DH EY _ IH G Z IH S T _ IH N _ N EY M _ AH L OW N .
I'm as fit as I can get. :: AY M _ AE Z _ F IH T _ AE Z _ AY _ K AE N _ G EH T .
Two people were interviewed. :: T UW _ P IY P AH L _ W ER _ IH N T ER V Y UW D .
Until they came to do it. :: AH N T IH L _ DH EY _ K EY M _ T UW _ D UW _ IH T .
It seems a long time ago. :: IH T _ S IY M Z _ AH _ L AO NG _ T AY M _ AH G OW .
Failure is not an option. :: F EY L Y ER _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AE N _ AA P SH AH N .
It has only been rumours. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ OW N L IY _ B IH N _ R UW M ER Z .
The fifth was found later. :: DH AH _ F IH F TH _ W AA Z _ F AW N D _ L EY T ER .
Scotland were on Saturday. :: S K AA T L AH N D _ W ER _ AA N _ S AE T ER D IY .
It wasn't a pretty match. :: IH T _ W AA Z AH N T _ AH _ P R IH T IY _ M AE CH .
Because I think it's there. :: B IH K AO Z _ AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T S _ DH EH R .
She is very distinctive. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ D IH S T IH NG K T IH V .
This is a big advantage. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ B IH G _ AE D V AE N T IH JH .
It was his own decision. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ HH IH Z _ OW N _ D IH S IH ZH AH N .
Two of our crew were killed. :: T UW _ AH V _ AW ER _ K R UW _ W ER _ K IH L D .
That's the bit that's wrong. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ B IH T _ DH AE T S _ R AO NG .
How do you take them away? :: HH AW _ D UW _ Y UW _ T EY K _ DH EH M _ AH W EY ?
That was a touch of class. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH _ T AH CH _ AH V _ K L AE S .
I didn't get to keep it. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ G EH T _ T UW _ K IY P _ IH T .
I didn't think so either. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ TH IH NG K _ S OW _ IY DH ER .
You have asked for action. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ AE S K T _ F AO R _ AE K SH AH N .
I was impressed with them. :: AY _ W AA Z _ IH M P R EH S T _ W IH DH _ DH EH M .
It was very full anyway. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ F UH L _ EH N IY W EY .
If only he knew himself. :: IH F _ OW N L IY _ HH IY _ N UW _ HH IH M S EH L F .
Just what we didn't need. :: JH AH S T _ W AH T _ W IY _ D IH D AH N T _ N IY D .
We never got off the bus. :: W IY _ N EH V ER _ G AA T _ AO F _ DH AH _ B AH S .
He is dying from cancer. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ D AY IH NG _ F R AH M _ K AE N S ER .
But now it's back to golf. :: B AH T _ N AW _ IH T S _ B AE K _ T UW _ G AA L F .
This could take a few days. :: DH IH S _ K UH D _ T EY K _ AH _ F Y UW _ D EY Z .
She is still very poorly. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ V EH R IY _ P UH R L IY .
I feel strongly about it. :: AY _ F IY L _ S T R AO NG L IY _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
Raised the way you want it. :: R EY Z D _ DH AH _ W EY _ Y UW _ W AA N T _ IH T .
It's unsafe for society. :: IH T S _ AH N S EY F _ F AO R _ S AH S AY AH T IY .
The feeling is marvellous. :: DH AH _ F IY L IH NG _ IH Z _ M AA R V AH L AH S .
I am happy with my form. :: AY _ AE M _ HH AE P IY _ W IH DH _ M AY _ F AO R M .
It's one up to the Scots. :: IH T S _ W AH N _ AH P _ T UW _ DH AH _ S K AA T S .
So there's a double whammy. :: S OW _ DH EH R Z _ AH _ D AH B AH L _ W AE M IY .
The whole team was rubbish. :: DH AH _ HH OW L _ T IY M _ W AA Z _ R AH B IH SH .
We are in a learning curve. :: W IY _ AA R _ IH N _ AH _ L ER N IH NG _ K ER V .
How good is Lennox Lewis? :: HH AW _ G UH D _ IH Z _ L EH N AH K S _ L UW IH S ?
He's not very big, either. :: HH IY Z _ N AA T _ V EH R IY _ B IH G , IY DH ER .
It was total confusion. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T OW T AH L _ K AH N F Y UW ZH AH N .
I think it is wide open. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T _ IH Z _ W AY D _ OW P AH N .
We have fun in our lives. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ F AH N _ IH N _ AW ER _ L IH V Z .
But there is another side. :: B AH T _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH N AH DH ER _ S AY D .
It is a high time to act. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ HH AY _ T AY M _ T UW _ AE K T .
Hear what they have to say. :: HH IY R _ W AH T _ DH EY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ S EY .
I was chosen to do this. :: AY _ W AA Z _ CH OW Z AH N _ T UW _ D UW _ DH IH S .
But there's no eye contact. :: B AH T _ DH EH R Z _ N OW _ AY _ K AA N T AE K T .
But will they fall in love? :: B AH T _ W IH L _ DH EY _ F AO L _ IH N _ L AH V ?
I am a little bit tired. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ L IH T AH L _ B IH T _ T AY ER D .
She has the biggest part. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ DH AH _ B IH G AH S T _ P AA R T .
It's a long-term solution. :: IH T S _ AH _ L AO NG T ER M _ S AH L UW SH AH N .
I am not a fan of books. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ AH _ F AE N _ AH V _ B UH K S .
That is my personal view. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ M AY _ P ER S IH N IH L _ V Y UW .
Anyone can take a photo. :: EH N IY W AH N _ K AE N _ T EY K _ AH _ F OW T OW .
You never had it so good. :: Y UW _ N EH V ER _ HH AE D _ IH T _ S OW _ G UH D .

It is a big time for me. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ B IH G _ T AY M _ F AO R _ M IY .

We are not ruling it out. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ R UW L IH NG _ IH T _ AW T .
I think he was surprised. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ S ER P R AY Z D .
I spoke to him yesterday. :: AY _ S P OW K _ T UW _ HH IH M _ Y EH S T ER D EY .
More cases are expected. :: M AO R _ K EY S AH Z _ AA R _ IH K S P EH K T AH D .
We're not getting involved. :: W IY R _ N AA T _ G EH T IH NG _ IH N V AA L V D .
I think we can get there. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ W IY _ K AE N _ G EH T _ DH EH R .
It's the body that counts. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ B AA D IY _ DH AE T _ K AW N T S .
That is to miss the point. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ T UW _ M IH S _ DH AH _ P OY N T .
Where is the human rights? :: W EH R _ IH Z _ DH AH _ HH Y UW M AH N _ R AY T S ?
We just want a fair deal. :: W IY _ JH AH S T _ W AA N T _ AH _ F EH R _ D IY L .
It is a hangover effect. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ HH AE NG OW V ER _ IH F EH K T .
I don't want to come down. :: AY _ D OW N T _ W AA N T _ T UW _ K AH M _ D AW N .
I want to create events. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ K R IY EY T _ IH V EH N T S .

He is having a nightmare. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ HH AE V IH NG _ AH _ N AY T M EH R .
Is it on a building site? :: IH Z _ IH T _ AA N _ AH _ B IH L D IH NG _ S AY T ?
There is so much at stake. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ S OW _ M AH CH _ AE T _ S T EY K .
It is not for me to say. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ F AO R _ M IY _ T UW _ S EY .
It was highly successful. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ HH AY L IY _ S AH K S EH S F AH L .
It has been well worth it. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ W EH L _ W ER TH _ IH T .
Everyone knew the family. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ N UW _ DH AH _ F AE M AH L IY .
What sort of man is that? :: W AH T _ S AO R T _ AH V _ M AE N _ IH Z _ DH AE T ?
There will be new memories. :: DH EH R _ W IH L _ B IY _ N UW _ M EH M ER IY Z .
They will do something big. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ D UW _ S AH M TH IH NG _ B IH G .
We are making no comment. :: W IY _ AA R _ M EY K IH NG _ N OW _ K AA M EH N T .
This place is outstanding. :: DH IH S _ P L EY S _ IH Z _ AW T S T AE N D IH NG .
Just look at his record. :: JH AH S T _ L UH K _ AE T _ HH IH Z _ R AH K AO R D .
I have been there already. :: AY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ DH EH R _ AO L R EH D IY .
How do you take them away? :: HH AW _ D UW _ Y UW _ T EY K _ DH EH M _ AH W EY ?
I don't have many friends. :: AY _ D OW N T _ HH AE V _ M EH N IY _ F R EH N D Z .
That is very hard, alone. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ HH AA R D , AH L OW N .
I felt he was excellent. :: AY _ F EH L T _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ EH K S AH L AH N T .
They have not got anyone. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ G AA T _ EH N IY W AH N .
It was worth a photograph. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ W ER TH _ AH _ F OW T AH G R AE F .
We should be able to cope. :: W IY _ SH UH D _ B IY _ EY B AH L _ T UW _ K OW P .
He was prepared for this. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ P R IY P EH R D _ F AO R _ DH IH S .
His second was a beauty. :: HH IH Z _ S EH K AH N D _ W AA Z _ AH _ B Y UW T IY .
They need to win a trophy. :: DH EY _ N IY D _ T UW _ W IH N _ AH _ T R OW F IY .
It had been on the cards. :: IH T _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ AA N _ DH AH _ K AA R D Z .
That's as good as it gets. :: DH AE T S _ AE Z _ G UH D _ AE Z _ IH T _ G EH T S .
No progress has been made. :: N OW _ P R AA G R EH S _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ M EY D .
It was just another play. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AH N AH DH ER _ P L EY .
How independent is that? :: HH AW _ IH N D IH P EH N D AH N T _ IH Z _ DH AE T ?
I haven't been ill at all. :: AY _ HH AE V AH N T _ B IH N _ IH L _ AE T _ AO L .
We did it for the jersey. :: W IY _ D IH D _ IH T _ F AO R _ DH AH _ JH ER Z IY .

We have to go for a win. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G OW _ F AO R _ AH _ W IH N .

We want to keep the pound. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ K IY P _ DH AH _ P AW N D .
And rugby fans can help. :: AH N D _ R AH G B IY _ F AE N Z _ K AE N _ HH EH L P .
It sounds a lot of money. :: IH T _ S AW N D Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ M AH N IY .
Instead, he missed the lot. :: IH N S T EH D , HH IY _ M IH S T _ DH AH _ L AA T .
There is no reason at all. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ R IY Z AH N _ AE T _ AO L .
Now that business is banned. :: N AW _ DH AE T _ B IH Z N AH S _ IH Z _ B AE N D .

But she was very human. :: B AH T _ SH IY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ HH Y UW M AH N .
The referee had been right. :: DH AH _ R EH F ER IY _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ R AY T .
No such meeting took place. :: N OW _ S AH CH _ M IY T IH NG _ T UH K _ P L EY S .
The options seem limited. :: DH AH _ AA P SH AH N Z _ S IY M _ L IH M AH T AH D .
I can't get away from it. :: AY _ K AE N T _ G EH T _ AH W EY _ F R AH M _ IH T .
It's quite crucial for me. :: IH T S _ K W AY T _ K R UW SH AH L _ F AO R _ M IY .
WE all watch the same match. :: W IY _ AO L _ W AA CH _ DH AH _ S EY M _ M AE CH .
He was also a great man. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AO L S OW _ AH _ G R EY T _ M AE N .
The next week is crucial. :: DH AH _ N EH K S T _ W IY K _ IH Z _ K R UW SH AH L .
This decision is a farce. :: DH IH S _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ IH Z _ AH _ F AA R S .
But it is a slow process. :: B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ S L OW _ P R AA S EH S .
That will be the sweetness. :: DH AE T _ W IH L _ B IY _ DH AH _ S W IY T N AH S .
I'm looking to the future. :: AY M _ L UH K IH NG _ T UW _ DH AH _ F Y UW CH ER .
They are still very quiet. :: DH EY _ AA R _ S T IH L _ V EH R IY _ K W AY AH T .
This is a total mystery. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ T OW T AH L _ M IH S T ER IY .
There is a lack of logic. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ L AE K _ AH V _ L AA JH IH K .
Something has got to give. :: S AH M TH IH NG _ HH AE Z _ G AA T _ T UW _ G IH V .
It gets into the culture. :: IH T _ G EH T S _ IH N T UW _ DH AH _ K AH L CH ER .
They were a lovely family. :: DH EY _ W ER _ AH _ L AH V L IY _ F AE M AH L IY .
Drugs are always an issue. :: D R AH G Z _ AA R _ AO L W EY Z _ AE N _ IH SH UW .
My parents are exhausted. :: M AY _ P EH R AH N T S _ AA R _ IH G Z AO S T AH D .
The same goes for McKenna. :: DH AH _ S EY M _ G OW Z _ F AO R _ M AH K EH N AH .
You've gotten all the facts. :: Y UW V _ G AA T AH N _ AO L _ DH AH _ F AE K T S .
It is not a road of life. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ R OW D _ AH V _ L AY F .
This is the real thing now. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ R IY L _ TH IH NG _ N AW .
They have to work so hard. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ W ER K _ S OW _ HH AA R D .
This has gone on too long. :: DH IH S _ HH AE Z _ G AO N _ AA N _ T UW _ L AO NG .
This takes the pressure off. :: DH IH S _ T EY K S _ DH AH _ P R EH SH ER _ AO F .
We're very, very excited. :: W IY R _ V EH R IY , V EH R IY _ IH K S AY T AH D .
Such is the ego involved. :: S AH CH _ IH Z _ DH AH _ IY G OW _ IH N V AA L V D .

It was a crucial moment. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ K R UW SH AH L _ M OW M AH N T .
We have great team spirit. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G R EY T _ T IY M _ S P IH R AH T .
Glasgow then took control. :: G L AE S K OW _ DH EH N _ T UH K _ K AH N T R OW L .
We couldn't go very fast. :: W IY _ K UH D AH N T _ G OW _ V EH R IY _ F AE S T .
The punishment was swift. :: DH AH _ P AH N IH SH M AH N T _ W AA Z _ S W IH F T .
I'm very angry about it. :: AY M _ V EH R IY _ AE NG G R IY _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
It will be easier for us. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ IY Z IY ER _ F AO R _ AH S .

All of us know it exists. :: AO L _ AH V _ AH S _ N OW _ IH T _ IH G Z IH S T S .
It was a matter of chance. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ M AE T ER _ AH V _ CH AE N S .

It was that kind of night. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AE T _ K AY N D _ AH V _ N AY T .
I tried to push him away. :: AY _ T R AY D _ T UW _ P UH SH _ HH IH M _ AH W EY .
I understood that concern. :: AY _ AH N D ER S T UH D _ DH AE T _ K AH N S ER N .
She had denied the charge. :: SH IY _ HH AE D _ D IH N AY D _ DH AH _ CH AA R JH .
I was shocked and outraged. :: AY _ W AA Z _ SH AA K T _ AH N D _ AW T R EY JH D .
Do you want a cup of tea. :: D UW _ Y UW _ W AA N T _ AH _ K AH P _ AH V _ T IY .
I've had a very long run. :: AY V _ HH AE D _ AH _ V EH R IY _ L AO NG _ R AH N .
I said, What does this mean? :: AY _ S EH D , W AH T _ D AH Z _ DH IH S _ M IY N ?
Is it a threat to union? :: IH Z _ IH T _ AH _ TH R EH T _ T UW _ Y UW N Y AH N ?
We did not talk about it. :: W IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ T AO K _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
There is something in this. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ S AH M TH IH NG _ IH N _ DH IH S .
It is not standing army. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ S T AE N D IH NG _ AA R M IY .
It's part of the end game. :: IH T S _ P AA R T _ AH V _ DH AH _ EH N D _ G EY M .
I have friends in Glasgow. :: AY _ HH AE V _ F R EH N D Z _ IH N _ G L AE S K OW .
It means it is difficult. :: IH T _ M IY N Z _ IH T _ IH Z _ D IH F AH K AH L T .
My condition is not bad. :: M AY _ K AH N D IH SH AH N _ IH Z _ N AA T _ B AE D .
That was very important. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ IH M P AO R T AH N T .
We know the goals will come. :: W IY _ N OW _ DH AH _ G OW L Z _ W IH L _ K AH M .
You'll have to wait and see. :: Y UW L _ HH AE V _ T UW _ W EY T _ AH N D _ S IY .
We didn't deserve to win. :: W IY _ D IH D AH N T _ D IH Z ER V _ T UW _ W IH N .
Who do you think will win? :: HH UW _ D UW _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K _ W IH L _ W IH N ?
They are working very well. :: DH EY _ AA R _ W ER K IH NG _ V EH R IY _ W EH L .
We lost out a little bit. :: W IY _ L AO S T _ AW T _ AH _ L IH T AH L _ B IH T .
She died a few days later. :: SH IY _ D AY D _ AH _ F Y UW _ D EY Z _ L EY T ER .
It wants them to go home. :: IH T _ W AA N T S _ DH EH M _ T UW _ G OW _ HH OW M .
That did not go down well. :: DH AE T _ D IH D _ N AA T _ G OW _ D AW N _ W EH L .
I've got a long way to go. :: AY V _ G AA T _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY _ T UW _ G OW .
It is one of those things. :: IH T _ IH Z _ W AH N _ AH V _ DH OW Z _ TH IH NG Z .
We don't know what happened. :: W IY _ D OW N T _ N OW _ W AH T _ HH AE P AH N D .
I just wasn't very good. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ W AA Z AH N T _ V EH R IY _ G UH D .
You realise what this means? :: Y UW _ R IY L AY Z _ W AH T _ DH IH S _ M IY N Z ?
We know we can defend it. :: W IY _ N OW _ W IY _ K AE N _ D IH F EH N D _ IH T .
We have a long way to go. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY _ T UW _ G OW .
Stardom is a funny thing. :: S T AA R D AH M _ IH Z _ AH _ F AH N IY _ TH IH NG .
I am in a good position. :: AY _ AE M _ IH N _ AH _ G UH D _ P AH Z IH SH AH N .
How did it all come about? :: HH AW _ D IH D _ IH T _ AO L _ K AH M _ AH B AW T ?
They get money for it now. :: DH EY _ G EH T _ M AH N IY _ F AO R _ IH T _ N AW .
We tried to get them down. :: W IY _ T R AY D _ T UW _ G EH T _ DH EH M _ D AW N .
That is one point of view. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ W AH N _ P OY N T _ AH V _ V Y UW .
Allison is not convinced. :: AE L AH S AH N _ IH Z _ N AA T _ K AH N V IH N S T .
But there is good and bad. :: B AH T _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ G UH D _ AH N D _ B AE D .
Doesn't matter what you do. :: D AH Z AH N T _ M AE T ER _ W AH T _ Y UW _ D UW .
This is a judgment issue. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ JH AH JH M AH N T _ IH SH UW .
We don't want that at all. :: W IY _ D OW N T _ W AA N T _ DH AE T _ AE T _ AO L .
Therefore there is a threat. :: DH EH R F AO R _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ TH R EH T .
But was it really so big? :: B AH T _ W AA Z _ IH T _ R IH L IY _ S OW _ B IH G ?
It requires a wider team. :: IH T _ R IY K W AY ER Z _ AH _ W AY D ER _ T IY M .
We have got away with it. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ AH W EY _ W IH DH _ IH T .
This is great news for us. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ G R EY T _ N UW Z _ F AO R _ AH S .
I don't make it mystical. :: AY _ D OW N T _ M EY K _ IH T _ M IH S T IH K AH L .
Because we do not need it. :: B IH K AO Z _ W IY _ D UW _ N AA T _ N IY D _ IH T .
Is there a new way forward? :: IH Z _ DH EH R _ AH _ N UW _ W EY _ F AO R W ER D ?
Next league matches Celtic. :: N EH K S T _ L IY G _ M AE CH AH Z _ S EH L T IH K .
May not have been at fault? :: M EY _ N AA T _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ AE T _ F AO L T ?
It was a good performance. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G UH D _ P ER F AO R M AH N S .

I'm pleased about one thing. :: AY M _ P L IY Z D _ AH B AW T _ W AH N _ TH IH NG .
His body was never found. :: HH IH Z _ B AA D IY _ W AA Z _ N EH V ER _ F AW N D .
Referees are easy targets. :: R EH F ER IY Z _ AA R _ IY Z IY _ T AA R G AH T S .
That's the law of the land. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ L AO _ AH V _ DH AH _ L AE N D .
Their attitude is all wrong. :: DH EH R _ AE T AH T UW D _ IH Z _ AO L _ R AO NG .
What happened in that game? :: W AH T _ HH AE P AH N D _ IH N _ DH AE T _ G EY M ?
If it doesn't, it doesn't. :: IH F _ IH T _ D AH Z AH N T , IH T _ D AH Z AH N T .
They can leave at any time. :: DH EY _ K AE N _ L IY V _ AE T _ EH N IY _ T AY M .
Life was like a timetable. :: L AY F _ W AA Z _ L AY K _ AH _ T AY M T EY B AH L .
Safety was also an issue. :: S EY F T IY _ W AA Z _ AO L S OW _ AE N _ IH SH UW .
It is difficult for Ali. :: IH T _ IH Z _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ F AO R _ AA L IY .

Two of the team became ill. :: T UW _ AH V _ DH AH _ T IY M _ B IH K EY M _ IH L .
I came home by ambulance. :: AY _ K EY M _ HH OW M _ B AY _ AE M B Y AH L AH N S .
Which can happen any time. :: W IH CH _ K AE N _ HH AE P AH N _ EH N IY _ T AY M .
Must have been at the bar. :: M AH S T _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ AE T _ DH AH _ B AA R .
I can see their argument. :: AY _ K AE N _ S IY _ DH EH R _ AA R G Y AH M AH N T .
There was a rush of water. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ R AH SH _ AH V _ W AO T ER .
My life has been destroyed. :: M AY _ L AY F _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ D IH S T R OY D .
It gave no further details. :: IH T _ G EY V _ N OW _ F ER DH ER _ D IH T EY L Z .
It is now the big brother. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AW _ DH AH _ B IH G _ B R AH DH ER .
I was just so determined. :: AY _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ S OW _ D IH T ER M AH N D .
It starts with the script. :: IH T _ S T AA R T S _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ S K R IH P T .
We can all make a mistake. :: W IY _ K AE N _ AO L _ M EY K _ AH _ M IH S T EY K .
It is the same in Sweden. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S EY M _ IH N _ S W IY D AH N .
The matter is under appeal. :: DH AH _ M AE T ER _ IH Z _ AH N D ER _ AH P IY L .
They have set the standard. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ S EH T _ DH AH _ S T AE N D ER D .
That is always a problem. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AO L W EY Z _ AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
We did something about it. :: W IY _ D IH D _ S AH M TH IH NG _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
He is not a team captain. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ T IY M _ K AE P T AH N .
It is very hard for her. :: IH T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ HH AA R D _ F AO R _ HH ER .
It is a cause for concern. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ K AA Z _ F AO R _ K AH N S ER N .
Not if you know the person. :: N AA T _ IH F _ Y UW _ N OW _ DH AH _ P ER S AH N .
He will be advised by me. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ B IY _ AE D V AY Z D _ B AY _ M IY .
He had planned to sell it. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ P L AE N D _ T UW _ S EH L _ IH T .
Little is known about them. :: L IH T AH L _ IH Z _ N OW N _ AH B AW T _ DH EH M .
We have not been approached. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ B IH N _ AH P R OW CH T .
The body follows the mind. :: DH AH _ B AA D IY _ F AA L OW Z _ DH AH _ M AY N D .
But it's a subtle process. :: B AH T _ IH T S _ AH _ S AH T AH L _ P R AA S EH S .
It's like a high school play. :: IH T S _ L AY K _ AH _ HH AY _ S K UW L _ P L EY .
It was a test in itself. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ T EH S T _ IH N _ IH T S EH L F .
Everything is in the mix. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ IH Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ M IH K S .
There is a demand for it. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ D IH M AE N D _ F AO R _ IH T .
Tony Blair said as little. :: T OW N IY _ B L EH R _ S EH D _ AE Z _ L IH T AH L .

There's still no-one like him. :: DH EH R Z _ S T IH L _ N UW N _ L AY K _ HH IH M .
Schools do not create that. :: S K UW L Z _ D UW _ N AA T _ K R IY EY T _ DH AE T .
That's what set him apart. :: DH AE T S _ W AH T _ S EH T _ HH IH M _ AH P AA R T .
We want immediate action. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ IH M IY D IY AH T _ AE K SH AH N .

The bank was now involved. :: DH AH _ B AE NG K _ W AA Z _ N AW _ IH N V AA L V D .
It was a poor performance. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ P UH R _ P ER F AO R M AH N S .
It is the same old story. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S EY M _ OW L D _ S T AO R IY .
Which may be the same thing. :: W IH CH _ M EY _ B IY _ DH AH _ S EY M _ TH IH NG .
We were looking for a base. :: W IY _ W ER _ L UH K IH NG _ F AO R _ AH _ B EY S .
He died the following year. :: HH IY _ D AY D _ DH AH _ F AA L OW IH NG _ Y IH R .
It is the same with Barry. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S EY M _ W IH DH _ B AE R IY .
It was that kind of match. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AE T _ K AY N D _ AH V _ M AE CH .
We have some options there. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ S AH M _ AA P SH AH N Z _ DH EH R .

Now we look forward to it. :: N AW _ W IY _ L UH K _ F AO R W ER D _ T UW _ IH T .
This is a very high price. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ HH AY _ P R AY S .

It starts to get you down. :: IH T _ S T AA R T S _ T UW _ G EH T _ Y UW _ D AW N .
This could prove a problem. :: DH IH S _ K UH D _ P R UW V _ AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
They loved it and it showed. :: DH EY _ L AH V D _ IH T _ AH N D _ IH T _ SH OW D .
He was always nice to me. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AO L W EY Z _ N AY S _ T UW _ M IY .
And how he kept his word. :: AH N D _ HH AW _ HH IY _ K EH P T _ HH IH Z _ W ER D .
Several others were absent. :: S EH V R AH L _ AH DH ER Z _ W ER _ AE B S AH N T .

They must be on commission. :: DH EY _ M AH S T _ B IY _ AA N _ K AH M IH SH AH N .
He is a reporter for us. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ R IH P AO R T ER _ F AO R _ AH S .

It doesn't make them evil. :: IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ M EY K _ DH EH M _ IY V AH L .

They really did a great job. :: DH EY _ R IH L IY _ D IH D _ AH _ G R EY T _ JH AA B .
What was the main difference? :: W AH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ M EY N _ D IH F ER AH N S ?
Sadly, it could not be done. :: S AE D L IY , IH T _ K UH D _ N AA T _ B IY _ D AH N .
I was delighted to accept. :: AY _ W AA Z _ D IH L AY T AH D _ T UW _ AE K S EH P T .
It's too horrible to think. :: IH T S _ T UW _ HH AO R AH B AH L _ T UW _ TH IH NG K .

You are not going in blind. :: Y UW _ AA R _ N AA T _ G OW IH NG _ IH N _ B L AY N D .
We were leading by two goals. :: W IY _ W ER _ L IY D IH NG _ B AY _ T UW _ G OW L Z .
He makes time for everyone. :: HH IY _ M EY K S _ T AY M _ F AO R _ EH V R IY W AH N .
Analysts welcomed the news. :: AE N AH L AH S T S _ W EH L K AH M D _ DH AH _ N UW Z .
It will take place in July. :: IH T _ W IH L _ T EY K _ P L EY S _ IH N _ JH UW L AY .
I am very happy with life. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ HH AE P IY _ W IH DH _ L AY F .

He knew his job inside out. :: HH IY _ N UW _ HH IH Z _ JH AA B _ IH N S AY D _ AW T .
YOU thought it was a headache. :: Y UW _ TH AO T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH EH D EY K .
The pound has also suffered. :: DH AH _ P AW N D _ HH AE Z _ AO L S OW _ S AH F ER D .
I am pleased to be in them. :: AY _ AE M _ P L IY Z D _ T UW _ B IY _ IH N _ DH EH M .
Bombing is the easy option. :: B AA M IH NG _ IH Z _ DH AH _ IY Z IY _ AA P SH AH N .
I have lost all confidence. :: AY _ HH AE V _ L AO S T _ AO L _ K AA N F AH D AH N S .
You have got to be careful. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ T UW _ B IY _ K EH R F AH L .
What do they want us to do? :: W AH T _ D UW _ DH EY _ W AA N T _ AH S _ T UW _ D UW ?
A job is a job, after all. :: AH _ JH AA B _ IH Z _ AH _ JH AA B , AE F T ER _ AO L .
It is an industry failure. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AE N _ IH N D AH S T R IY _ F EY L Y ER .
That is surely worth a try. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ SH UH R L IY _ W ER TH _ AH _ T R AY .
This is a load of nonsense. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ L OW D _ AH V _ N AA N S EH N S .
It would be very dangerous. :: IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ V EH R IY _ D EY N JH ER AH S .
He loves the big occasions. :: HH IY _ L AH V Z _ DH AH _ B IH G _ AH K EY ZH AH N Z .
It was a horrible moment. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH AO R AH B AH L _ M OW M AH N T .
Here the jury is still out. :: HH IY R _ DH AH _ JH UH R IY _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ AW T .
Our season is not finished. :: AW ER _ S IY Z AH N _ IH Z _ N AA T _ F IH N IH SH T .
Who would be in that desert? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ B IY _ IH N _ DH AE T _ D EH Z ER T ?
They've got their own agenda. :: DH EY V _ G AA T _ DH EH R _ OW N _ AH JH EH N D AH .
That takes a lot of courage. :: DH AE T _ T EY K S _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ K ER AH JH .
I decided to take my time. :: AY _ D IH S AY D IH D _ T UW _ T EY K _ M AY _ T AY M .
The company's in good shape. :: DH AH _ K AH M P AH N IY Z _ IH N _ G UH D _ SH EY P .
I'd rather have been playing. :: AY D _ R AE DH ER _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ P L EY IH NG .
That's not part of the deal. :: DH AE T S _ N AA T _ P AA R T _ AH V _ DH AH _ D IY L .
It seemed to have direction. :: IH T _ S IY M D _ T UW _ HH AE V _ D ER EH K SH AH N .
Who will run the bigger show? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ R AH N _ DH AH _ B IH G ER _ SH OW ?
That can happen so easily. :: DH AE T _ K AE N _ HH AE P AH N _ S OW _ IY Z AH L IY .
They would never let him go. :: DH EY _ W UH D _ N EH V ER _ L EH T _ HH IH M _ G OW .
Charles Clarke is an idiot. :: CH AA R L Z _ K L AA R K _ IH Z _ AE N _ IH D IY AH T .
We're into that build-up now. :: W IY R _ IH N T UW _ DH AE T _ B IH L D AH P _ N AW .
Some have other commitments. :: S AH M _ HH AE V _ AH DH ER _ K AH M IH T M AH N T S .
Mike Tyson went to prison. :: M AY K _ T AY S AH N _ W EH N T _ T UW _ P R IH Z AH N .
You can't keep them separate. :: Y UW _ K AE N T _ K IY P _ DH EH M _ S EH P ER EY T .
She is a very lucky lady. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ L AH K IY _ L EY D IY .
This is a mental challenge. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ M EH N T AH L _ CH AE L AH N JH .
What, then, is the real thing? :: W AH T , DH EH N , IH Z _ DH AH _ R IY L _ TH IH NG ?
I won't go back to Holland. :: AY _ W OW N T _ G OW _ B AE K _ T UW _ HH AA L AH N D .
Justice was not seen today. :: JH AH S T AH S _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ S IY N _ T AH D EY .
I don't think it is vital. :: AY _ D OW N T _ TH IH NG K _ IH T _ IH Z _ V AY T AH L .
Each day is a new beginning. :: IY CH _ D EY _ IH Z _ AH _ N UW _ B IH G IH N IH NG .
So the process was refined. :: S OW _ DH AH _ P R AA S EH S _ W AA Z _ R AH F AY N D .
Peter doesn't want to leave. :: P IY T ER _ D AH Z AH N T _ W AA N T _ T UW _ L IY V .
It is now time for justice. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AW _ T AY M _ F AO R _ JH AH S T AH S .
There's a lot of hysteria. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ HH IH S T EH R IY AH .
It is still with Ministers. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ W IH DH _ M IH N AH S T ER Z .
We're still talking about it. :: W IY R _ S T IH L _ T AO K IH NG _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
And we all understand that. :: AH N D _ W IY _ AO L _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ DH AE T .
But he is not using them. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ Y UW Z IH NG _ DH EH M .
I'm sorry to hear this news. :: AY M _ S AA R IY _ T UW _ HH IY R _ DH IH S _ N UW Z .
I'm not a threat to coaches. :: AY M _ N AA T _ AH _ TH R EH T _ T UW _ K OW CH IH Z .
This is an internal matter. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AE N _ IH N T ER N AH L _ M AE T ER .
The Open champion is back. :: DH AH _ OW P AH N _ CH AE M P IY AH N _ IH Z _ B AE K .
I am deeply sorry they did. :: AY _ AE M _ D IY P L IY _ S AA R IY _ DH EY _ D IH D .
And he has a tale to tell. :: AH N D _ HH IY _ HH AE Z _ AH _ T EY L _ T UW _ T EH L .
The change was not instant. :: DH AH _ CH EY N JH _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ IH N S T AH N T .
I hope you don't regret it. :: AY _ HH OW P _ Y UW _ D OW N T _ R AH G R EH T _ IH T .
It's a very special unit. :: IH T S _ AH _ V EH R IY _ S P EH SH AH L _ Y UW N AH T .
They've been wonderful to me. :: DH EY V _ B IH N _ W AH N D ER F AH L _ T UW _ M IY .
Yet it does not lose appeal. :: Y EH T _ IH T _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ L UW Z _ AH P IY L .
The court has not decided. :: DH AH _ K AO R T _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ D IH S AY D IH D .
It's nothing to do with me. :: IH T S _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ D UW _ W IH DH _ M IY .
On occasions he succeeded. :: AA N _ AH K EY ZH AH N Z _ HH IY _ S AH K S IY D AH D .

I saw it later in the news. :: AY _ S AO _ IH T _ L EY T ER _ IH N _ DH AH _ N UW Z .
He was shaking like a leaf. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ SH EY K IH NG _ L AY K _ AH _ L IY F .
That was always the danger. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AO L W EY Z _ DH AH _ D EY N JH ER .
That was no surprise to me. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ N OW _ S ER P R AY Z _ T UW _ M IY .
It is a beautiful country. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ B Y UW T AH F AH L _ K AH N T R IY .
There were too many mistakes. :: DH EH R _ W ER _ T UW _ M EH N IY _ M IH S T EY K S .

I am very happy with him. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ HH AE P IY _ W IH DH _ HH IH M .
His instructions were clear. :: HH IH Z _ IH N S T R AH K SH AH N Z _ W ER _ K L IH R .
I'm looking forward to that. :: AY M _ L UH K IH NG _ F AO R W ER D _ T UW _ DH AE T .
There was mystery back then. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ M IH S T ER IY _ B AE K _ DH EH N .
The Government has listened. :: DH AH _ G AH V ER M AH N T _ HH AE Z _ L IH S AH N D .
I have never considered it. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N EH V ER _ K AH N S IH D ER D _ IH T .
The club has never won it. :: DH AH _ K L AH B _ HH AE Z _ N EH V ER _ W AH N _ IH T .
It's just a failing service. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ AH _ F EY L IH NG _ S ER V AH S .
You didn't get a modified. :: Y UW _ D IH D AH N T _ G EH T _ AH _ M AA D AH F AY D .
Only one was from Glasgow. :: OW N L IY _ W AH N _ W AA Z _ F R AH M _ G L AE S K OW .
She has never mentioned it. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ N EH V ER _ M EH N SH AH N D _ IH T .
That's not the way to think. :: DH AE T S _ N AA T _ DH AH _ W EY _ T UW _ TH IH NG K .
They will be very physical. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ B IY _ V EH R IY _ F IH Z IH K AH L .
We were getting very worried. :: W IY _ W ER _ G EH T IH NG _ V EH R IY _ W ER IY D .
He will never be forgotten. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ N EH V ER _ B IY _ F ER G AA T AH N .
We are getting not a penny. :: W IY _ AA R _ G EH T IH NG _ N AA T _ AH _ P EH N IY .
They will not be going back. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ N AA T _ B IY _ G OW IH NG _ B AE K .
We can all understand that. :: W IY _ K AE N _ AO L _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ DH AE T .
I hope that doesn't happen. :: AY _ HH OW P _ DH AE T _ D AH Z AH N T _ HH AE P AH N .
We have to get on with it. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G EH T _ AA N _ W IH DH _ IH T .
Where is the logic in that? :: W EH R _ IH Z _ DH AH _ L AA JH IH K _ IH N _ DH AE T ?
My son was too young to die. :: M AY _ S AH N _ W AA Z _ T UW _ Y AH NG _ T UW _ D AY .
This is a club on the rise. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ K L AH B _ AA N _ DH AH _ R AY Z .
There may be reasons for it. :: DH EH R _ M EY _ B IY _ R IY Z AH N Z _ F AO R _ IH T .
This is the time to use it. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ T AY M _ T UW _ Y UW S _ IH T .
I'm just a regular person. :: AY M _ JH AH S T _ AH _ R EH G Y AH L ER _ P ER S AH N .
Nato was not a love affair. :: N EY T OW _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH _ L AH V _ AH F EH R .
It is an amazing response. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AE N _ AH M EY Z IH NG _ R IH S P AA N S .
He is not very big, either. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ N AA T _ V EH R IY _ B IH G , IY DH ER .
What do they want us to do? :: W AH T _ D UW _ DH EY _ W AA N T _ AH S _ T UW _ D UW ?
Alex Ferguson is the same. :: AE L AH K S _ F ER G AH S AH N _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S EY M .
Today I couldn't run on it. :: T AH D EY _ AY _ K UH D AH N T _ R AH N _ AA N _ IH T .
The hotel was now for sale. :: DH AH _ HH OW T EH L _ W AA Z _ N AW _ F AO R _ S EY L .
He did not know his daughter. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ N OW _ HH IH Z _ D AO T ER .
What was the main difference? :: W AH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ M EY N _ D IH F ER AH N S ?
That was the theory, anyway. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ TH IH R IY , EH N IY W EY .
Here is a question for you. :: HH IY R _ IH Z _ AH _ K W EH S CH AH N _ F AO R _ Y UW .
We feel very good about it. :: W IY _ F IY L _ V EH R IY _ G UH D _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
I always knew she was funny. :: AY _ AO L W EY Z _ N UW _ SH IY _ W AA Z _ F AH N IY .
It carried a double message. :: IH T _ K AE R IY D _ AH _ D AH B AH L _ M EH S AH JH .
New Year will be very busy. :: N UW _ Y IH R _ W IH L _ B IY _ V EH R IY _ B IH Z IY .
Neither man has been charged. :: N IY DH ER _ M AE N _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ CH AA R JH D .
You have to do your research. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ D UW _ Y AO R _ R IY S ER CH .
It added to the spectacle. :: IH T _ AE D AH D _ T UW _ DH AH _ S P EH K T AH K AH L .
The end result is the same. :: DH AH _ EH N D _ R IH Z AH L T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S EY M .
Everything else is a bonus. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ EH L S _ IH Z _ AH _ B OW N AH S .

Something has got to change. :: S AH M TH IH NG _ HH AE Z _ G AA T _ T UW _ CH EY N JH .
Kenny Miller might come through. :: K EH N IY _ M IH L ER _ M AY T _ K AH M _ TH R UW .
Have a look at our accounts. :: HH AE V _ AH _ L UH K _ AE T _ AW ER _ AH K AW N T S .
It may be good for the soul. :: IH T _ M EY _ B IY _ G UH D _ F AO R _ DH AH _ S OW L .
All the pressure was on him. :: AO L _ DH AH _ P R EH SH ER _ W AA Z _ AA N _ HH IH M .
It involved the same people. :: IH T _ IH N V AA L V D _ DH AH _ S EY M _ P IY P AH L .
We don't even know his name. :: W IY _ D OW N T _ IY V IH N _ N OW _ HH IH Z _ N EY M .

I think I'm a bit too young. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ AY M _ AH _ B IH T _ T UW _ Y AH NG .
Their bodies were never found. :: DH EH R _ B AA D IY Z _ W ER _ N EH V ER _ F AW N D .
Not one person spoke badly. :: N AA T _ W AH N _ P ER S AH N _ S P OW K _ B AE D L IY .
The women are victims here. :: DH AH _ W IH M AH N _ AA R _ V IH K T AH M Z _ HH IY R .
It is simple, but profound. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S IH M P AH L , B AH T _ P R OW F AW N D .
I've had a wonderful career. :: AY V _ HH AE D _ AH _ W AH N D ER F AH L _ K ER IH R .
There was no trouble at all. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ T R AH B AH L _ AE T _ AO L .

Overall, we are very pleased. :: OW V ER AO L , W IY _ AA R _ V EH R IY _ P L IY Z D .
I wish I could see it again. :: AY _ W IH SH _ AY _ K UH D _ S IY _ IH T _ AH G EH N .
It's not a marketing scheme. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ AH _ M AA R K AH T IH NG _ S K IY M .
They might surprise themselves. :: DH EY _ M AY T _ S ER P R AY Z _ DH EH M S EH L V Z .
They really had a go at us. :: DH EY _ R IH L IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ G OW _ AE T _ AH S .
The tickets are on their way. :: DH AH _ T IH K AH T S _ AA R _ AA N _ DH EH R _ W EY .

He could see no other bidder. :: HH IY _ K UH D _ S IY _ N OW _ AH DH ER _ B IH D ER .
Survival is not an option. :: S ER V AY V AH L _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AE N _ AA P SH AH N .
It carries a double message. :: IH T _ K AE R IY Z _ AH _ D AH B AH L _ M EH S AH JH .
It was a family tragedy. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ F AE M AH L IY _ T R AE JH AH D IY .
That was a problem for me. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH _ P R AA B L AH M _ F AO R _ M IY .
It was a good game to watch. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G UH D _ G EY M _ T UW _ W AA CH .
They had been forced to walk. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ F AO R S T _ T UW _ W AO K .
The effects are not all bad. :: DH AH _ IH F EH K T S _ AA R _ N AA T _ AO L _ B AE D .
I can feel the sound inside. :: AY _ K AE N _ F IY L _ DH AH _ S AW N D _ IH N S AY D .
First meeting was next week. :: F ER S T _ M IY T IH NG _ W AA Z _ N EH K S T _ W IY K .
It wasn't about one player. :: IH T _ W AA Z AH N T _ AH B AW T _ W AH N _ P L EY ER .
That was him under pressure. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ HH IH M _ AH N D ER _ P R EH SH ER .
We've got better players here. :: W IY V _ G AA T _ B EH T ER _ P L EY ER Z _ HH IY R .
We were extremely arrogant. :: W IY _ W ER _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ EH R AH G AH N T .
It's up to the defence team. :: IH T S _ AH P _ T UW _ DH AH _ D IH F EH N S _ T IY M .
The house was so well alight. :: DH AH _ HH AW S _ W AA Z _ S OW _ W EH L _ AH L AY T .
I now know that from memory. :: AY _ N AW _ N OW _ DH AE T _ F R AH M _ M EH M ER IY .
There's a strong involvement. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ S T R AO NG _ IH N V AA L V M AH N T .
Everything is so commercial. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ IH Z _ S OW _ K AH M ER SH AH L .
They have nowhere else to go. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ N OW W EH R _ EH L S _ T UW _ G OW .
The trial continues today. :: DH AH _ T R AY AH L _ K AH N T IH N Y UW Z _ T AH D EY .
It was not known to myself. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ N OW N _ T UW _ M AY S EH L F .
It has never been worthwhile. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ N EH V ER _ B IH N _ W ER TH W AY L .
I'm sure he didn't mean it. :: AY M _ SH UH R _ HH IY _ D IH D AH N T _ M IY N _ IH T .
This is the same old story. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S EY M _ OW L D _ S T AO R IY .
The place became a war zone. :: DH AH _ P L EY S _ B IH K EY M _ AH _ W AO R _ Z OW N .
I am prepared to step down. :: AY _ AE M _ P R IY P EH R D _ T UW _ S T EH P _ D AW N .
He will become the sovereign. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ B IH K AH M _ DH AH _ S AA V R AH N .
He is a law unto himself. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ L AO _ AH N T UW _ HH IH M S EH L F .
Who has the second highest? :: HH UW _ HH AE Z _ DH AH _ S EH K AH N D _ HH AY AH S T ?
Ferguson did not hesitate. :: F ER G AH S AH N _ D IH D _ N AA T _ HH EH Z AH T EY T .
It is good for their eyesight. :: IH T _ IH Z _ G UH D _ F AO R _ DH EH R _ AY S AY T .
This is a United Kingdom. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ Y UW N AY T AH D _ K IH NG D AH M .
Our young people are leaving. :: AW ER _ Y AH NG _ P IY P AH L _ AA R _ L IY V IH NG .
It had a gigantic effect. :: IH T _ HH AE D _ AH _ JH AY G AE N T IH K _ IH F EH K T .
I hope they understand that. :: AY _ HH OW P _ DH EY _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ DH AE T .
They make it look very easy. :: DH EY _ M EY K _ IH T _ L UH K _ V EH R IY _ IY Z IY .
I had a sense of deja vu. :: AY _ HH AE D _ AH _ S EH N S _ AH V _ D IY JH AH _ V UW .
Are you listening, All Saints? :: AA R _ Y UW _ L IH S AH N IH NG , AO L _ S EY N T S ?
They don't know how to do it. :: DH EY _ D OW N T _ N OW _ HH AW _ T UW _ D UW _ IH T .
These are terrible offences. :: DH IY Z _ AA R _ T EH R AH B AH L _ AH F EH N S IH Z .
They also have good neighbours. :: DH EY _ AO L S OW _ HH AE V _ G UH D _ N EY B ER Z .
Motorists will welcome this. :: M OW T ER AH S T S _ W IH L _ W EH L K AH M _ DH IH S .
Clubs can only do so much. :: K L AH B Z _ K AE N _ OW N L IY _ D UW _ S OW _ M AH CH .
I got off to a great start. :: AY _ G AA T _ AO F _ T UW _ AH _ G R EY T _ S T AA R T .

I don't know how it happened. :: AY _ D OW N T _ N OW _ HH AW _ IH T _ HH AE P AH N D .
This is just one example. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ JH AH S T _ W AH N _ IH G Z AE M P AH L .
It's never the same problem. :: IH T S _ N EH V ER _ DH AH _ S EY M _ P R AA B L AH M .
We will miss him very much. :: W IY _ W IH L _ M IH S _ HH IH M _ V EH R IY _ M AH CH .
I just went a bit too far. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ W EH N T _ AH _ B IH T _ T UW _ F AA R .
I find it rather oppressive. :: AY _ F AY N D _ IH T _ R AE DH ER _ AH P R EH S IH V .
It was just above the roof. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AH B AH V _ DH AH _ R UW F .
Haven't been so lucky since. :: HH AE V AH N T _ B IH N _ S OW _ L AH K IY _ S IH N S .
It is a very big problem. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ B IH G _ P R AA B L AH M .
It's an awful lot of money. :: IH T S _ AE N _ AA F AH L _ L AA T _ AH V _ M AH N IY .
That would be a big mistake. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ B IY _ AH _ B IH G _ M IH S T EY K .
There was no pressure at all. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ P R EH SH ER _ AE T _ AO L .
This one is a special case. :: DH IH S _ W AH N _ IH Z _ AH _ S P EH SH AH L _ K EY S .
But when we do it is great. :: B AH T _ W EH N _ W IY _ D UW _ IH T _ IH Z _ G R EY T .
Closure is not one of them. :: K L OW ZH ER _ IH Z _ N AA T _ W AH N _ AH V _ DH EH M .
I didn't play all that well. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ P L EY _ AO L _ DH AE T _ W EH L .
Rangers deserved to beat us. :: R EY N JH ER Z _ D IH Z ER V D _ T UW _ B IY T _ AH S .
I'm not putting myself down. :: AY M _ N AA T _ P AH T IH NG _ M AY S EH L F _ D AW N .
It is a natural reaction. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ N AE CH ER AH L _ R IY AE K SH AH N .
Everyone was very saddened. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ S AE D AH N D .
It's got to be in the head. :: IH T S _ G AA T _ T UW _ B IY _ IH N _ DH AH _ HH EH D .
That, in a way, is the point. :: DH AE T , IH N _ AH _ W EY , IH Z _ DH AH _ P OY N T .
It's a production company. :: IH T S _ AH _ P R AH D AH K SH AH N _ K AH M P AH N IY .
But what will we put on it? :: B AH T _ W AH T _ W IH L _ W IY _ P UH T _ AA N _ IH T ?
It is so elusive and light. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S OW _ IH L UW S IH V _ AH N D _ L AY T .
I was delighted with Robbie. :: AY _ W AA Z _ D IH L AY T AH D _ W IH DH _ R AA B IY .

I want to be there by right. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ B IY _ DH EH R _ B AY _ R AY T .
We must learn from the past. :: W IY _ M AH S T _ L ER N _ F R AH M _ DH AH _ P AE S T .
There's nothing for the kids. :: DH EH R Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ F AO R _ DH AH _ K IH D Z .
We are not far from a deal. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ F AA R _ F R AH M _ AH _ D IY L .
Or some thought that they have. :: AO R _ S AH M _ TH AO T _ DH AE T _ DH EY _ HH AE V .
I wanted to win so badly. :: AY _ W AA N T AH D _ T UW _ W IH N _ S OW _ B AE D L IY .
Yet therein is the problem. :: Y EH T _ DH EH R IH N _ IH Z _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
We are all in the frontline. :: W IY _ AA R _ AO L _ IH N _ DH AH _ F R AH N T L AY N .
It happened again yesterday. :: IH T _ HH AE P AH N D _ AH G EH N _ Y EH S T ER D EY .
I don't know how she does it. :: AY _ D OW N T _ N OW _ HH AW _ SH IY _ D AH Z _ IH T .
That was my first reaction. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ M AY _ F ER S T _ R IY AE K SH AH N .
This is a disaster for us. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ D IH Z AE S T ER _ F AO R _ AH S .
They have not changed at all. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ CH EY N JH D _ AE T _ AO L .
There are not enough of them. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ N AA T _ IH N AH F _ AH V _ DH EH M .
He had finally had enough. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ F AY N AH L IY _ HH AE D _ IH N AH F .
It is sad and frustrating. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S AE D _ AH N D _ F R AH S T R EY T IH NG .
But they miss the whole point. :: B AH T _ DH EY _ M IH S _ DH AH _ HH OW L _ P OY N T .
This was a good performance. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ AH _ G UH D _ P ER F AO R M AH N S .
Our future was his future. :: AW ER _ F Y UW CH ER _ W AA Z _ HH IH Z _ F Y UW CH ER .
I have had a lovely summer. :: AY _ HH AE V _ HH AE D _ AH _ L AH V L IY _ S AH M ER .
We are not physical at all. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ F IH Z IH K AH L _ AE T _ AO L .
I'm working on that one, too. :: AY M _ W ER K IH NG _ AA N _ DH AE T _ W AH N , T UW .
The results were very clear. :: DH AH _ R IH Z AH L T S _ W ER _ V EH R IY _ K L IH R .
It attracted no complaints. :: IH T _ AH T R AE K T AH D _ N OW _ K AH M P L EY N T S .
It came in bits and pieces. :: IH T _ K EY M _ IH N _ B IH T S _ AH N D _ P IY S AH Z .
My life is going to go on. :: M AY _ L AY F _ IH Z _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ G OW _ AA N .
It's not Big Brother at sea. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ B IH G _ B R AH DH ER _ AE T _ S IY .
He will not be coming back. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ N AA T _ B IY _ K AH M IH NG _ B AE K .
It's never been to committee. :: IH T S _ N EH V ER _ B IH N _ T UW _ K AH M IH T IY .
The nation has his music. :: DH AH _ N EY SH AH N _ HH AE Z _ HH IH Z _ M Y UW Z IH K .
Clearly, there was a mix-up. :: K L IH R L IY , DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ M IH K S AH P .
But he was far from alone. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ F AA R _ F R AH M _ AH L OW N .
They want to win the title. :: DH EY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ W IH N _ DH AH _ T AY T AH L .
There is no doubt about that. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ D AW T _ AH B AW T _ DH AE T .
The attitude was good today. :: DH AH _ AE T AH T UW D _ W AA Z _ G UH D _ T AH D EY .
This is as bad as it gets. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AE Z _ B AE D _ AE Z _ IH T _ G EH T S .
I know we ask a lot of you. :: AY _ N OW _ W IY _ AE S K _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ Y UW .
There's no reason for panic. :: DH EH R Z _ N OW _ R IY Z AH N _ F AO R _ P AE N IH K .
It is coming on very well. :: IH T _ IH Z _ K AH M IH NG _ AA N _ V EH R IY _ W EH L .
Everyone here is very sad. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ HH IY R _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ S AE D .
I am not changing my mind. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ CH EY N JH IH NG _ M AY _ M AY N D .
Scotland will play its part. :: S K AA T L AH N D _ W IH L _ P L EY _ IH T S _ P AA R T .
This is a national crisis. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ N AE SH AH N AH L _ K R AY S AH S .
If the director is with you. :: IH F _ DH AH _ D ER EH K T ER _ IH Z _ W IH DH _ Y UW .
I am not obsessed with sex. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ AH B S EH S T _ W IH DH _ S EH K S .
It was so new, so exciting. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S OW _ N UW , S OW _ IH K S AY T IH NG .
That was the easy election. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ IY Z IY _ IH L EH K SH AH N .
Well, the big day has arrived. :: W EH L , DH AH _ B IH G _ D EY _ HH AE Z _ ER AY V D .
I would relish the prospect. :: AY _ W UH D _ R EH L IH SH _ DH AH _ P R AA S P EH K T .
We always felt we could win. :: W IY _ AO L W EY Z _ F EH L T _ W IY _ K UH D _ W IH N .
He is at war with his knee. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AE T _ W AO R _ W IH DH _ HH IH Z _ N IY .
I was there five months ago. :: AY _ W AA Z _ DH EH R _ F AY V _ M AH N TH S _ AH G OW .
You may have a short memory. :: Y UW _ M EY _ HH AE V _ AH _ SH AO R T _ M EH M ER IY .
Last year, I was pretty bad. :: L AE S T _ Y IH R , AY _ W AA Z _ P R IH T IY _ B AE D .
It is a terrible tragedy. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ T EH R AH B AH L _ T R AE JH AH D IY .
It seems a shame to leave it. :: IH T _ S IY M Z _ AH _ SH EY M _ T UW _ L IY V _ IH T .
It's the real thing, for sure. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ R IY L _ TH IH NG , F AO R _ SH UH R .
Five members were disciplined. :: F AY V _ M EH M B ER Z _ W ER _ D IH S AH P L AH N D .
And we had a good response. :: AH N D _ W IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ G UH D _ R IH S P AA N S .
It was a great experience. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ IH K S P IH R IY AH N S .
I am considered a teenager. :: AY _ AE M _ K AH N S IH D ER D _ AH _ T IY N EY JH ER .
It's only a matter of scale. :: IH T S _ OW N L IY _ AH _ M AE T ER _ AH V _ S K EY L .
It brought in new management. :: IH T _ B R AO T _ IH N _ N UW _ M AE N AH JH M AH N T .
And it covers the spectrum. :: AH N D _ IH T _ K AH V ER Z _ DH AH _ S P EH K T R AH M .
Winning a medal is a dream. :: W IH N IH NG _ AH _ M EH D AH L _ IH Z _ AH _ D R IY M .
I had it before the final. :: AY _ HH AE D _ IH T _ B IH F AO R _ DH AH _ F AY N AH L .
He seems to have everything. :: HH IY _ S IY M Z _ T UW _ HH AE V _ EH V R IY TH IH NG .
Diversions were put in place. :: D IH V ER ZH AH N Z _ W ER _ P UH T _ IH N _ P L EY S .
It has been recorded twice. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ R AH K AO R D AH D _ T W AY S .
They will probably come back. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ P R AA B AH B L IY _ K AH M _ B AE K .
My father died in childbirth. :: M AY _ F AA DH ER _ D AY D _ IH N _ CH AY L D B ER TH .
We go there with confidence. :: W IY _ G OW _ DH EH R _ W IH DH _ K AA N F AH D AH N S .
But it's an enjoyable job. :: B AH T _ IH T S _ AE N _ EH N JH OY AH B AH L _ JH AA B .
It was a pre-emptive strike. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ P R IY EH M P T IH V _ S T R AY K .
It's unlikely to be renewed. :: IH T S _ AH N L AY K L IY _ T UW _ B IY _ R IH N UW D .
That all hope is never lost. :: DH AE T _ AO L _ HH OW P _ IH Z _ N EH V ER _ L AO S T .
She brought a lot to my life. :: SH IY _ B R AO T _ AH _ L AA T _ T UW _ M AY _ L AY F .
This is a fight to the death. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ F AY T _ T UW _ DH AH _ D EH TH .
He is a man of the people. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ M AE N _ AH V _ DH AH _ P IY P AH L .
You've got to have both sides. :: Y UW V _ G AA T _ T UW _ HH AE V _ B OW TH _ S AY D Z .
We are not going to forget. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ F ER G EH T .
Others agreed with this view. :: AH DH ER Z _ AH G R IY D _ W IH DH _ DH IH S _ V Y UW .
A Home Office spokesman said. :: AH _ HH OW M _ AO F AH S _ S P OW K S M AH N _ S EH D .
He deserves a second chance. :: HH IY _ D IH Z ER V Z _ AH _ S EH K AH N D _ CH AE N S .
But the fans deserve to know! :: B AH T _ DH AH _ F AE N Z _ D IH Z ER V _ T UW _ N OW !
It will be very, very tight. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ V EH R IY , V EH R IY _ T AY T .
It was a kind of contempt. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ K AY N D _ AH V _ K AH N T EH M P T .
I was conceived in Aberdeen. :: AY _ W AA Z _ K AH N S IY V D _ IH N _ AE B ER D IY N .
I agree with you about this. :: AY _ AH G R IY _ W IH DH _ Y UW _ AH B AW T _ DH IH S .
Good players have become bad. :: G UH D _ P L EY ER Z _ HH AE V _ B IH K AH M _ B AE D .
One finding emerged clearly. :: W AH N _ F AY N D IH NG _ IH M ER JH D _ K L IH R L IY .
I'd like to report a murder. :: AY D _ L AY K _ T UW _ R IY P AO R T _ AH _ M ER D ER .
The whole thing will be great. :: DH AH _ HH OW L _ TH IH NG _ W IH L _ B IY _ G R EY T .
They were totally behind it. :: DH EY _ W ER _ T OW T AH L IY _ B IH HH AY N D _ IH T .
No, because it was too many. :: N OW , B IH K AO Z _ IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ M EH N IY .
Nothing would now surprise me. :: N AH TH IH NG _ W UH D _ N AW _ S ER P R AY Z _ M IY .
He plays only for himself. :: HH IY _ P L EY Z _ OW N L IY _ F AO R _ HH IH M S EH L F .
The referee had a good game. :: DH AH _ R EH F ER IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ G UH D _ G EY M .
It's going to take some time. :: IH T S _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ T EY K _ S AH M _ T AY M .
We are in a global market. :: W IY _ AA R _ IH N _ AH _ G L OW B AH L _ M AA R K AH T .
He's been active in Arabia. :: HH IY Z _ B IH N _ AE K T IH V _ IH N _ ER EY B IY AH .
It is a matter of clarity. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ M AE T ER _ AH V _ K L EH R AH T IY .
That, though, is an old story. :: DH AE T , DH OW , IH Z _ AE N _ OW L D _ S T AO R IY .
We have no knowledge of this. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ N OW _ N AA L AH JH _ AH V _ DH IH S .
But there was no going back. :: B AH T _ DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ G OW IH NG _ B AE K .
The issues are very intense. :: DH AH _ IH SH UW Z _ AA R _ V EH R IY _ IH N T EH N S .
A suspicion was not enough. :: AH _ S AH S P IH SH AH N _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ IH N AH F .
We didn't mean to kill him. :: W IY _ D IH D AH N T _ M IY N _ T UW _ K IH L _ HH IH M .
So far he has not done so. :: S OW _ F AA R _ HH IY _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ D AH N _ S OW .
I feel alive and good today. :: AY _ F IY L _ AH L AY V _ AH N D _ G UH D _ T AH D EY .
It's too big a risk to take. :: IH T S _ T UW _ B IH G _ AH _ R IH S K _ T UW _ T EY K .
The line-up is a tasty one. :: DH AH _ L AY N AH P _ IH Z _ AH _ T EY S T IY _ W AH N .
Instead, she just went away. :: IH N S T EH D , SH IY _ JH AH S T _ W EH N T _ AH W EY .
I'm getting back up there now. :: AY M _ G EH T IH NG _ B AE K _ AH P _ DH EH R _ N AW .
We only lost the third goal. :: W IY _ OW N L IY _ L AO S T _ DH AH _ TH ER D _ G OW L .
This one was my best chance. :: DH IH S _ W AH N _ W AA Z _ M AY _ B EH S T _ CH AE N S .
Smith has not let him down. :: S M IH TH _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ L EH T _ HH IH M _ D AW N .
They had not been handcuffed. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ N AA T _ B IH N _ HH AE N D K AH F T .
The frustration was showing. :: DH AH _ F R AH S T R EY SH AH N _ W AA Z _ SH OW IH NG .
And then came the seventies. :: AH N D _ DH EH N _ K EY M _ DH AH _ S EH V AH N T IY Z .
I can't believe it's all gone. :: AY _ K AE N T _ B IH L IY V _ IH T S _ AO L _ G AO N .
The search has been called off. :: DH AH _ S ER CH _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ K AO L D _ AO F .
It is no place for a poet. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N OW _ P L EY S _ F AO R _ AH _ P OW AH T .
There is a club on the rise. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ K L AH B _ AA N _ DH AH _ R AY Z .
That would have been too easy. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ T UW _ IY Z IY .
We didn't take our chances. :: W IY _ D IH D AH N T _ T EY K _ AW ER _ CH AE N S AH Z .
There may be some resistance. :: DH EH R _ M EY _ B IY _ S AH M _ R IH Z IH S T AH N S .
Then there was her childhood. :: DH EH N _ DH EH R _ W AA Z _ HH ER _ CH AY L D HH UH D .
His first album was a hit. :: HH IH Z _ F ER S T _ AE L B AH M _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH IH T .
Nor is it likely to do so. :: N AO R _ IH Z _ IH T _ L AY K L IY _ T UW _ D UW _ S OW .
And we've beaten them before. :: AH N D _ W IY V _ B IY T AH N _ DH EH M _ B IH F AO R .
I'm amazed at what he's done. :: AY M _ AH M EY Z D _ AE T _ W AH T _ HH IY Z _ D AH N .
Folk music is in her blood. :: F OW K _ M Y UW Z IH K _ IH Z _ IH N _ HH ER _ B L AH D .
I wouldn't give them a grade. :: AY _ W UH D AH N T _ G IH V _ DH EH M _ AH _ G R EY D .
Weaknesses there are, however. :: W IY K N AH S AH Z _ DH EH R _ AA R , HH AW EH V ER .
Which brings us to the point. :: W IH CH _ B R IH NG Z _ AH S _ T UW _ DH AH _ P OY N T .
Everyone thought they were safe. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ TH AO T _ DH EY _ W ER _ S EY F .
The Insider opens tomorrow. :: DH AH _ IH N S AY D ER _ OW P AH N Z _ T AH M AA R OW .
But who shot the president? :: B AH T _ HH UW _ SH AA T _ DH AH _ P R EH Z AH D EH N T ?
He just carried on filming. :: HH IY _ JH AH S T _ K AE R IY D _ AA N _ F IH L M IH NG .
Everything is accounted for. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ IH Z _ AH K AW N T AH D _ F AO R .
We've got a mixture of both. :: W IY V _ G AA T _ AH _ M IH K S CH ER _ AH V _ B OW TH .
Safety is our first concern. :: S EY F T IY _ IH Z _ AW ER _ F ER S T _ K AH N S ER N .
It all depends on the wind. :: IH T _ AO L _ D IH P EH N D Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ W AY N D .
The answer is obviously no. :: DH AH _ AE N S ER _ IH Z _ AA B V IY AH S L IY _ N OW .
It's probably just as well. :: IH T S _ P R AA B AH B L IY _ JH AH S T _ AE Z _ W EH L .
My brother is not like that. :: M AY _ B R AH DH ER _ IH Z _ N AA T _ L AY K _ DH AE T .
Frankly it was disgusting. :: F R AE NG K L IY _ IH T _ W AA Z _ D IH S G AH S T IH NG .
She became very good at it. :: SH IY _ B IH K EY M _ V EH R IY _ G UH D _ AE T _ IH T .
He died later in hospital. :: HH IY _ D AY D _ L EY T ER _ IH N _ HH AA S P IH T AH L .
There's a hint of classical. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ HH IH N T _ AH V _ K L AE S IH K AH L .
But this is just the start. :: B AH T _ DH IH S _ IH Z _ JH AH S T _ DH AH _ S T AA R T .
I am looking forward to it. :: AY _ AE M _ L UH K IH NG _ F AO R W ER D _ T UW _ IH T .
Players have to accept this. :: P L EY ER Z _ HH AE V _ T UW _ AE K S EH P T _ DH IH S .
I've been waiting a long time. :: AY V _ B IH N _ W EY T IH NG _ AH _ L AO NG _ T AY M .
He has never let them down. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ N EH V ER _ L EH T _ DH EH M _ D AW N .
There are no second chances. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ N OW _ S EH K AH N D _ CH AE N S AH Z .
The response was really good. :: DH AH _ R IH S P AA N S _ W AA Z _ R IH L IY _ G UH D .
It is really special to me. :: IH T _ IH Z _ R IH L IY _ S P EH SH AH L _ T UW _ M IY .
This is only one example. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ OW N L IY _ W AH N _ IH G Z AE M P AH L .
It's more relaxing this way. :: IH T S _ M AO R _ R IH L AE K S IH NG _ DH IH S _ W EY .
There is a subtle difference. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ S AH T AH L _ D IH F ER AH N S .
We are not getting him back. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ G EH T IH NG _ HH IH M _ B AE K .
He didn't know where to look. :: HH IY _ D IH D AH N T _ N OW _ W EH R _ T UW _ L UH K .
She is under police escort. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ AH N D ER _ P AH L IY S _ EH S K AO R T .
I want to make a difference. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ M EY K _ AH _ D IH F ER AH N S .
There is another side to it. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH N AH DH ER _ S AY D _ T UW _ IH T .
He was a national treasure. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ N AE SH AH N AH L _ T R EH ZH ER .
It's always somebody else's. :: IH T S _ AO L W EY Z _ S AH M B AA D IY _ EH L S IH Z .
I certainly will not settle. :: AY _ S ER T AH N L IY _ W IH L _ N AA T _ S EH T AH L .
We are committed to the ban. :: W IY _ AA R _ K AH M IH T AH D _ T UW _ DH AH _ B AE N .
It became a book by itself. :: IH T _ B IH K EY M _ AH _ B UH K _ B AY _ IH T S EH L F .
The whole region is in shock. :: DH AH _ HH OW L _ R IY JH AH N _ IH Z _ IH N _ SH AA K .
Equity declined to comment. :: EH K W AH T IY _ D IH K L AY N D _ T UW _ K AA M EH N T .
I first met him last summer. :: AY _ F ER S T _ M EH T _ HH IH M _ L AE S T _ S AH M ER .
They lived for their children. :: DH EY _ L AY V D _ F AO R _ DH EH R _ CH IH L D R AH N .
I was shaking on the blocks. :: AY _ W AA Z _ SH EY K IH NG _ AA N _ DH AH _ B L AA K S .
His job was not advertised. :: HH IH Z _ JH AA B _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AE D V ER T AY Z D .
It is a terrible equation. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ T EH R AH B AH L _ IH K W EY ZH AH N .
They've got to account for it. :: DH EY V _ G AA T _ T UW _ AH K AW N T _ F AO R _ IH T .
They must play for each other. :: DH EY _ M AH S T _ P L EY _ F AO R _ IY CH _ AH DH ER .
I was as strong as a horse. :: AY _ W AA Z _ AE Z _ S T R AO NG _ AE Z _ AH _ HH AO R S .
The fire was above the hole. :: DH AH _ F AY ER _ W AA Z _ AH B AH V _ DH AH _ HH OW L .
They play together perfectly. :: DH EY _ P L EY _ T AH G EH DH ER _ P ER F AH K T L IY .
Yet the data is compelling. :: Y EH T _ DH AH _ D EY T AH _ IH Z _ K AH M P EH L IH NG .
This was a good move for me. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ AH _ G UH D _ M UW V _ F AO R _ M IY .
It is an impressive record. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AE N _ IH M P R EH S IH V _ R AH K AO R D .
He played it like a veteran. :: HH IY _ P L EY D _ IH T _ L AY K _ AH _ V EH T ER AH N .
That has been the easy part. :: DH AE T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ DH AH _ IY Z IY _ P AA R T .
It is also very valuable. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AO L S OW _ V EH R IY _ V AE L Y AH B AH L .
You have to see it like this. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ S IY _ IH T _ L AY K _ DH IH S .
He also presented You Bet! :: HH IY _ AO L S OW _ P R IY Z EH N T AH D _ Y UW _ B EH T !
I've had the time of my life. :: AY V _ HH AE D _ DH AH _ T AY M _ AH V _ M AY _ L AY F .
At first I thought I was gone. :: AE T _ F ER S T _ AY _ TH AO T _ AY _ W AA Z _ G AO N .
I've always been a sensitive. :: AY V _ AO L W EY Z _ B IH N _ AH _ S EH N S AH T IH V .
Glasgow is a friendly city. :: G L AE S K OW _ IH Z _ AH _ F R EH N D L IY _ S IH T IY .
Neither woman has been named. :: N IY DH ER _ W UH M AH N _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ N EY M D .
Let that be their memorial. :: L EH T _ DH AE T _ B IY _ DH EH R _ M AH M AO R IY AH L .
The performance is not there. :: DH AH _ P ER F AO R M AH N S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH EH R .
It would make a lot of sense. :: IH T _ W UH D _ M EY K _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ S EH N S .
He must have a crack at it. :: HH IY _ M AH S T _ HH AE V _ AH _ K R AE K _ AE T _ IH T .
And it's a goodbye from him. :: AH N D _ IH T S _ AH _ G UH D B AY _ F R AH M _ HH IH M .
He was jailed for four years. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ JH EY L D _ F AO R _ F AO R _ Y IH R Z .
Their campaign is in disarray. :: DH EH R _ K AE M P EY N _ IH Z _ IH N _ D IH S ER EY .
It became difficult for me. :: IH T _ B IH K EY M _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ F AO R _ M IY .
They will notice a difference. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ N OW T AH S _ AH _ D IH F ER AH N S .
The answer is with ourselves. :: DH AH _ AE N S ER _ IH Z _ W IH DH _ AW ER S EH L V Z .
It is an absolute nonsense. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AE N _ AE B S AH L UW T _ N AA N S EH N S .
Holland won by five wickets. :: HH AA L AH N D _ W AH N _ B AY _ F AY V _ W IH K AH T S .
Talk of a crisis is absurd. :: T AO K _ AH V _ AH _ K R AY S AH S _ IH Z _ AH B S ER D .
Harrowing is easy, after all. :: HH EH R OW IH NG _ IH Z _ IY Z IY , AE F T ER _ AO L .
It was really quite amazing. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ R IH L IY _ K W AY T _ AH M EY Z IH NG .
It was cynical and callous. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S IH N IH K AH L _ AH N D _ K AE L AH S .
This was a unique election. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ AH _ Y UW N IY K _ IH L EH K SH AH N .
I've come here for the jersey. :: AY V _ K AH M _ HH IY R _ F AO R _ DH AH _ JH ER Z IY .
Both sides have to step back. :: B OW TH _ S AY D Z _ HH AE V _ T UW _ S T EH P _ B AE K .
It should never have happened. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ N EH V ER _ HH AE V _ HH AE P AH N D .
The banking sector was weak. :: DH AH _ B AE NG K IH NG _ S EH K T ER _ W AA Z _ W IY K .
He was jailed for five years. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ JH EY L D _ F AO R _ F AY V _ Y IH R Z .
Is that a serious question? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ AH _ S IH R IY AH S _ K W EH S CH AH N ?
He has also cut a record. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ AO L S OW _ K AH T _ AH _ R AH K AO R D .
We have got to get it right. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ T UW _ G EH T _ IH T _ R AY T .
This would include insurance. :: DH IH S _ W UH D _ IH N K L UW D _ IH N SH UH R AH N S .
Must be prepared to use it. :: M AH S T _ B IY _ P R IY P EH R D _ T UW _ Y UW S _ IH T .
There's nothing natural left. :: DH EH R Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ N AE CH ER AH L _ L EH F T .
He could still be President. :: HH IY _ K UH D _ S T IH L _ B IY _ P R EH Z AH D EH N T .
Does that put pressure on us? :: D AH Z _ DH AE T _ P UH T _ P R EH SH ER _ AA N _ AH S ?
It is not a standing army. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ S T AE N D IH NG _ AA R M IY .
He must have seen the movie. :: HH IY _ M AH S T _ HH AE V _ S IY N _ DH AH _ M UW V IY .
Two years later, she was dead. :: T UW _ Y IH R Z _ L EY T ER , SH IY _ W AA Z _ D EH D .
You look like a rugby player. :: Y UW _ L UH K _ L AY K _ AH _ R AH G B IY _ P L EY ER .
In the end, it was no choice. :: IH N _ DH AH _ EH N D , IH T _ W AA Z _ N OW _ CH OY S .
It has been a waste of time. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ AH _ W EY S T _ AH V _ T AY M .
We are opening an inquiry. :: W IY _ AA R _ OW P AH N IH NG _ AE N _ IH N K W AY R IY .
We cannot ask for them back. :: W IY _ K AE N AA T _ AE S K _ F AO R _ DH EH M _ B AE K .
It disappeared into the cup. :: IH T _ D IH S AH P IH R D _ IH N T UW _ DH AH _ K AH P .
In fact, he was great today. :: IH N _ F AE K T , HH IY _ W AA Z _ G R EY T _ T AH D EY .
I couldn't honestly tell you. :: AY _ K UH D AH N T _ AA N AH S T L IY _ T EH L _ Y UW .
It is a flexible concept. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ F L EH K S AH B AH L _ K AA N S EH P T .
They make the right decisions. :: DH EY _ M EY K _ DH AH _ R AY T _ D IH S IH ZH AH N Z .
It was entirely justified. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ IH N T AY ER L IY _ JH AH S T AH F AY D .
So it looks like a done deal. :: S OW _ IH T _ L UH K S _ L AY K _ AH _ D AH N _ D IY L .
The shares are a strong hold. :: DH AH _ SH EH R Z _ AA R _ AH _ S T R AO NG _ HH OW L D .
It is very special for me. :: IH T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ S P EH SH AH L _ F AO R _ M IY .
It has been an amazing day. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ AE N _ AH M EY Z IH NG _ D EY .
To begin with it looks good. :: T UW _ B IH G IH N _ W IH DH _ IH T _ L UH K S _ G UH D .
And right now, it isn't there. :: AH N D _ R AY T _ N AW , IH T _ IH Z AH N T _ DH EH R .
In short, the club was broke. :: IH N _ SH AO R T , DH AH _ K L AH B _ W AA Z _ B R OW K .
The Commons is too outdated. :: DH AH _ K AA M AH N Z _ IH Z _ T UW _ AW T D EY T IH D .
I am not here to get even. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ HH IY R _ T UW _ G EH T _ IY V IH N .
I found the course inspiring. :: AY _ F AW N D _ DH AH _ K AO R S _ IH N S P AY R IH NG .
Then they killed another three. :: DH EH N _ DH EY _ K IH L D _ AH N AH DH ER _ TH R IY .
Is that what people we want? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ W AH T _ P IY P AH L _ W IY _ W AA N T ?
Visitors were also impressed. :: V IH Z AH T ER Z _ W ER _ AO L S OW _ IH M P R EH S T .
Are there muscular problems? :: AA R _ DH EH R _ M AH S K Y AH L ER _ P R AA B L AH M Z ?
I had no choice but to leave. :: AY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ CH OY S _ B AH T _ T UW _ L IY V .
We must get the three points. :: W IY _ M AH S T _ G EH T _ DH AH _ TH R IY _ P OY N T S .
You're not going to get hurt. :: Y UH R _ N AA T _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ G EH T _ HH ER T .
They said we were out of touch. :: DH EY _ S EH D _ W IY _ W ER _ AW T _ AH V _ T AH CH .
Public safety is paramount. :: P AH B L IH K _ S EY F T IY _ IH Z _ P EH R AH M AW N T .
We have grown up in Britain. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G R OW N _ AH P _ IH N _ B R IH T AH N .
They have got off with murder. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ AO F _ W IH DH _ M ER D ER .
He was as good as his word. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AE Z _ G UH D _ AE Z _ HH IH Z _ W ER D .
We're all in a state of shock. :: W IY R _ AO L _ IH N _ AH _ S T EY T _ AH V _ SH AA K .
I have a bunch of veterans. :: AY _ HH AE V _ AH _ B AH N CH _ AH V _ V EH T ER AH N Z .
This is normal for him now. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AO R M AH L _ F AO R _ HH IH M _ N AW .
Scotland is losing business. :: S K AA T L AH N D _ IH Z _ L UW Z IH NG _ B IH Z N AH S .
You might even have seen him. :: Y UW _ M AY T _ IY V IH N _ HH AE V _ S IY N _ HH IH M .
Both of them have looked good. :: B OW TH _ AH V _ DH EH M _ HH AE V _ L UH K T _ G UH D .
It's the best of both worlds. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ B EH S T _ AH V _ B OW TH _ W ER L D Z .
So what makes it so special? :: S OW _ W AH T _ M EY K S _ IH T _ S OW _ S P EH SH AH L ?
He was tough and relentless. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ T AH F _ AH N D _ R IH L EH N T L IH S .
It's the way we go about it. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ W EY _ W IY _ G OW _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
They just made me feel dizzy. :: DH EY _ JH AH S T _ M EY D _ M IY _ F IY L _ D IH Z IY .
This is a young team, you know. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ Y AH NG _ T IY M , Y UW _ N OW .
Today's ruling confirms that. :: T AH D EY Z _ R UW L IH NG _ K AH N F ER M Z _ DH AE T .
But it's got to be worth it. :: B AH T _ IH T S _ G AA T _ T UW _ B IY _ W ER TH _ IH T .
You have to feel for the guy. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ F IY L _ F AO R _ DH AH _ G AY .
He was charged with perjury. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ CH AA R JH D _ W IH DH _ P ER JH ER IY .
Partly, it is his own fault. :: P AA R T L IY , IH T _ IH Z _ HH IH Z _ OW N _ F AO L T .
But what are the songs about? :: B AH T _ W AH T _ AA R _ DH AH _ S AO NG Z _ AH B AW T ?
No, it's never been mentioned. :: N OW , IH T S _ N EH V ER _ B IH N _ M EH N SH AH N D .
She was a delightful person. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ D IH L AY T F AH L _ P ER S AH N .
I hope it comes out all right. :: AY _ HH OW P _ IH T _ K AH M Z _ AW T _ AO L _ R AY T .
Retirement is on his mind. :: R IY T AY ER M AH N T _ IH Z _ AA N _ HH IH Z _ M AY N D .
We need a much wider debate. :: W IY _ N IY D _ AH _ M AH CH _ W AY D ER _ D AH B EY T .
They use them for everything. :: DH EY _ Y UW S _ DH EH M _ F AO R _ EH V R IY TH IH NG .
It will be an eye for an eye. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ AE N _ AY _ F AO R _ AE N _ AY .
We were a little bit nervous. :: W IY _ W ER _ AH _ L IH T AH L _ B IH T _ N ER V AH S .
I have to keep working hard. :: AY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ K IY P _ W ER K IH NG _ HH AA R D .
That is difficult to answer. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ T UW _ AE N S ER .
No government has that right. :: N OW _ G AH V ER M AH N T _ HH AE Z _ DH AE T _ R AY T .
The chief constable is right. :: DH AH _ CH IY F _ K AA N S T AH B AH L _ IH Z _ R AY T .
The world is split into two. :: DH AH _ W ER L D _ IH Z _ S P L IH T _ IH N T UW _ T UW .
The hangover was Olympian. :: DH AH _ HH AE NG OW V ER _ W AA Z _ OW L IH M P IY AH N .
IT is a terrible equation. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ T EH R AH B AH L _ IH K W EY ZH AH N .
I have been there many times. :: AY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ DH EH R _ M EH N IY _ T AY M Z .
That is unlikely to happen. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AH N L AY K L IY _ T UW _ HH AE P AH N .
New Labour are running scared. :: N UW _ L EY B AW R _ AA R _ R AH N IH NG _ S K EH R D .
He has refused to do that. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ R AH F Y UW Z D _ T UW _ D UW _ DH AE T .
I didn't expect to be in. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ IH K S P EH K T _ T UW _ B IY _ IH N .
I don't want to do too much. :: AY _ D OW N T _ W AA N T _ T UW _ D UW _ T UW _ M AH CH .
It is extremely fortunate. :: IH T _ IH Z _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ F AO R CH AH N AH T .
It all happened so suddenly. :: IH T _ AO L _ HH AE P AH N D _ S OW _ S AH D AH N L IY .
I am not completely insane. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ K AH M P L IY T L IY _ IH N S EY N .
He has made a step forward. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ M EY D _ AH _ S T EH P _ F AO R W ER D .
I think we're the better side. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ W IY R _ DH AH _ B EH T ER _ S AY D .
It was not like that at all. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ L AY K _ DH AE T _ AE T _ AO L .
I thought it was a great game. :: AY _ TH AO T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ G EY M .
Our position is quite clear. :: AW ER _ P AH Z IH SH AH N _ IH Z _ K W AY T _ K L IH R .
They set up to win the hole. :: DH EY _ S EH T _ AH P _ T UW _ W IH N _ DH AH _ HH OW L .
What will happen to them now? :: W AH T _ W IH L _ HH AE P AH N _ T UW _ DH EH M _ N AW ?
That began as an accident. :: DH AE T _ B IH G AE N _ AE Z _ AE N _ AE K S AH D AH N T .
He had a decision to make. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ T UW _ M EY K .
I love the feel of the place. :: AY _ L AH V _ DH AH _ F IY L _ AH V _ DH AH _ P L EY S .
I'd rather be singing Verdi. :: AY D _ R AE DH ER _ B IY _ S IH NG IH NG _ V EH R D IY .
The classes are taking place. :: DH AH _ K L AE S AH Z _ AA R _ T EY K IH NG _ P L EY S .
Everyone was writing me off. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ W AA Z _ R AY T IH NG _ M IY _ AO F .
But that is about to change. :: B AH T _ DH AE T _ IH Z _ AH B AW T _ T UW _ CH EY N JH .
It was still there last night. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S T IH L _ DH EH R _ L AE S T _ N AY T .
I think it is a great shame. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ SH EY M .
The devil is in the detail. :: DH AH _ D EH V AH L _ IH Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ D IH T EY L .
We can play better than that. :: W IY _ K AE N _ P L EY _ B EH T ER _ DH AE N _ DH AE T .
I think we can overcome it. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ W IY _ K AE N _ OW V ER K AH M _ IH T .
I'm going to take it further. :: AY M _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ T EY K _ IH T _ F ER DH ER .
It was the dreaded sentence. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ D R EH D IH D _ S EH N T AH N S .
It is looking very special. :: IH T _ IH Z _ L UH K IH NG _ V EH R IY _ S P EH SH AH L .
People were hitting the floor. :: P IY P AH L _ W ER _ HH IH T IH NG _ DH AH _ F L AO R .
It has no place in football. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ N OW _ P L EY S _ IH N _ F UH T B AO L .
We should not be complacent. :: W IY _ SH UH D _ N AA T _ B IY _ K AH M P L EY S AH N T .
Two other men have recovered. :: T UW _ AH DH ER _ M EH N _ HH AE V _ R AH K AH V ER D .
It has been a great success. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ AH _ G R EY T _ S AH K S EH S .
But he's a very quiet man. :: B AH T _ HH IY Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ K W AY AH T _ M AE N .
It is an absolute disgrace. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AE N _ AE B S AH L UW T _ D IH S G R EY S .
I want to get at the truth. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ G EH T _ AE T _ DH AH _ T R UW TH .
Does that put pressure on us? :: D AH Z _ DH AE T _ P UH T _ P R EH SH ER _ AA N _ AH S ?
We have to break that cycle. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ B R EY K _ DH AE T _ S AY K AH L .
I expect a rapid response. :: AY _ IH K S P EH K T _ AH _ R AE P AH D _ R IH S P AA N S .
That is the important thing. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ IH M P AO R T AH N T _ TH IH NG .
One season, they might do well. :: W AH N _ S IY Z AH N , DH EY _ M AY T _ D UW _ W EH L .
That might mean another delay. :: DH AE T _ M AY T _ M IY N _ AH N AH DH ER _ D IH L EY .
We are still getting over it. :: W IY _ AA R _ S T IH L _ G EH T IH NG _ OW V ER _ IH T .
They will fight for everything. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ F AY T _ F AO R _ EH V R IY TH IH NG .
Is that a serious question? :: IH Z _ DH AE T _ AH _ S IH R IY AH S _ K W EH S CH AH N ?
Robert is a special talent. :: R AA B ER T _ IH Z _ AH _ S P EH SH AH L _ T AE L AH N T .
Until you hit the big games. :: AH N T IH L _ Y UW _ HH IH T _ DH AH _ B IH G _ G EY M Z .
We have the mental strength. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ M EH N T AH L _ S T R EH NG K TH .
He prefers to play for them. :: HH IY _ P R AH F ER Z _ T UW _ P L EY _ F AO R _ DH EH M .
They have broken the promise. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ B R OW K AH N _ DH AH _ P R AA M AH S .
That period was a struggle. :: DH AE T _ P IH R IY AH D _ W AA Z _ AH _ S T R AH G AH L .
The parties have no contact. :: DH AH _ P AA R T IY Z _ HH AE V _ N OW _ K AA N T AE K T .
He seemed to lose his focus. :: HH IY _ S IY M D _ T UW _ L UW Z _ HH IH Z _ F OW K AH S .
We will try to find someone. :: W IY _ W IH L _ T R AY _ T UW _ F AY N D _ S AH M W AH N .
They know it'll be fantastic. :: DH EY _ N OW _ IH T AH L _ B IY _ F AE N T AE S T IH K .
I am a committed European. :: AY _ AE M _ AH _ K AH M IH T AH D _ Y UH R AH P IY AH N .
They tried to give her advice. :: DH EY _ T R AY D _ T UW _ G IH V _ HH ER _ AE D V AY S .
It is not the message alone. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ M EH S AH JH _ AH L OW N .
It's the performance we want. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ P ER F AO R M AH N S _ W IY _ W AA N T .
It was a bit of a tightrope. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ B IH T _ AH V _ AH _ T AY T R OW P .
Sadly, it does not end there. :: S AE D L IY , IH T _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ EH N D _ DH EH R .
But you never won any games. :: B AH T _ Y UW _ N EH V ER _ W AH N _ EH N IY _ G EY M Z .
Let's not be too despondent. :: L EH T S _ N AA T _ B IY _ T UW _ D IH S P AA N D AH N T .
There was a fossil on screen. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ F AA S AH L _ AA N _ S K R IY N .
There is no internal damage. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ IH N T ER N AH L _ D AE M AH JH .
It seems a waste of talents. :: IH T _ S IY M Z _ AH _ W EY S T _ AH V _ T AE L AH N T S .
They haven't been thought through. :: DH EY _ HH AE V AH N T _ B IH N _ TH AO T _ TH R UW .
But it was not all bad news. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AO L _ B AE D _ N UW Z .
But they had to be paid for. :: B AH T _ DH EY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ B IY _ P EY D _ F AO R .
A play is a set of actions. :: AH _ P L EY _ IH Z _ AH _ S EH T _ AH V _ AE K SH AH N Z .
His only reply was a laugh. :: HH IH Z _ OW N L IY _ R IH P L AY _ W AA Z _ AH _ L AE F .
Ferguson must take the blame. :: F ER G AH S AH N _ M AH S T _ T EY K _ DH AH _ B L EY M .
I think it's a great system. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T S _ AH _ G R EY T _ S IH S T AH M .
That includes the equipment? :: DH AE T _ IH N K L UW D Z _ DH AH _ IH K W IH P M AH N T ?
She started to put on weight. :: SH IY _ S T AA R T AH D _ T UW _ P UH T _ AA N _ W EY T .
The second failed completely. :: DH AH _ S EH K AH N D _ F EY L D _ K AH M P L IY T L IY .
That apart, though, I feel good. :: DH AE T _ AH P AA R T , DH OW , AY _ F IY L _ G UH D .
The proposal was rejected. :: DH AH _ P R AH P OW Z AH L _ W AA Z _ R IH JH EH K T IH D .
This was the perfect setting. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ P ER F EH K T _ S EH T IH NG .
It's a source of deep concern. :: IH T S _ AH _ S AO R S _ AH V _ D IY P _ K AH N S ER N .
And sooner than we may think. :: AH N D _ S UW N ER _ DH AE N _ W IY _ M EY _ TH IH NG K .
We had another last Tuesday. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ AH N AH DH ER _ L AE S T _ T UW Z D IY .
We think the timing is good. :: W IY _ TH IH NG K _ DH AH _ T AY M IH NG _ IH Z _ G UH D .
It means an enormous amount. :: IH T _ M IY N Z _ AE N _ IH N AO R M AH S _ AH M AW N T .
Nobody has told the story. :: N OW B AA D IY _ HH AE Z _ T OW L D _ DH AH _ S T AO R IY .
She came to the Highland Show. :: SH IY _ K EY M _ T UW _ DH AH _ HH AY L AH N D _ SH OW .
That is the general feeling. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ JH EH N ER AH L _ F IY L IH NG .
It's been a long, long journey. :: IH T S _ B IH N _ AH _ L AO NG , L AO NG _ JH ER N IY .
I was born for this moment. :: AY _ W AA Z _ B AO R N _ F AO R _ DH IH S _ M OW M AH N T .
Neither had any other career. :: N IY DH ER _ HH AE D _ EH N IY _ AH DH ER _ K ER IH R .
We'll have to think about it. :: W IY L _ HH AE V _ T UW _ TH IH NG K _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
We like being the underdogs. :: W IY _ L AY K _ B IY IH NG _ DH AH _ AH N D ER D AO G Z .
It is quite a thing to watch. :: IH T _ IH Z _ K W AY T _ AH _ TH IH NG _ T UW _ W AA CH .
A, The media has been great. :: AH , DH AH _ M IY D IY AH _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ G R EY T .
Well, the climate has changed. :: W EH L , DH AH _ K L AY M AH T _ HH AE Z _ CH EY N JH D .
The professor is in no doubt. :: DH AH _ P R AH F EH S ER _ IH Z _ IH N _ N OW _ D AW T .
SE is well down that road. :: S AW TH IY S T _ IH Z _ W EH L _ D AW N _ DH AE T _ R OW D .
THERE's only one word for it. :: DH EH R Z _ OW N L IY _ W AH N _ W ER D _ F AO R _ IH T .
He should be worried about me. :: HH IY _ SH UH D _ B IY _ W ER IY D _ AH B AW T _ M IY .
There are moments of silence. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ M OW M AH N T S _ AH V _ S AY L AH N S .
I knew she was going to win. :: AY _ N UW _ SH IY _ W AA Z _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ W IH N .
I'm just gonna hit the shot. :: AY M _ JH AH S T _ G AA N AH _ HH IH T _ DH AH _ SH AA T .
I think in three dimensions. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH N _ TH R IY _ D IH M EH N SH AH N Z .
So what's wrong with Scotland? :: S OW _ W AH T S _ R AO NG _ W IH DH _ S K AA T L AH N D ?
Our children are our future. :: AW ER _ CH IH L D R AH N _ AA R _ AW ER _ F Y UW CH ER .
They feel it belongs to them. :: DH EY _ F IY L _ IH T _ B IH L AO NG Z _ T UW _ DH EH M .
I just have to accept that. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ HH AE V _ T UW _ AE K S EH P T _ DH AE T .
He edited the press release. :: HH IY _ EH D AH T AH D _ DH AH _ P R EH S _ R IY L IY S .
I saw it in a different way. :: AY _ S AO _ IH T _ IH N _ AH _ D IH F ER AH N T _ W EY .
For sure we want to win it. :: F AO R _ SH UH R _ W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ W IH N _ IH T .
David Trimble has sold out. :: D EY V IH D _ T R IH M B AH L _ HH AE Z _ S OW L D _ AW T .
She makes me feel very proud. :: SH IY _ M EY K S _ M IY _ F IY L _ V EH R IY _ P R AW D .
She was charged with perjury. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ CH AA R JH D _ W IH DH _ P ER JH ER IY .
So, where do we go from here? :: S OW , W EH R _ D UW _ W IY _ G OW _ F R AH M _ HH IY R ?
I'll go out and be aggressive. :: AY L _ G OW _ AW T _ AH N D _ B IY _ AH G R EH S IH V .
They chose to side with terror. :: DH EY _ CH OW Z _ T UW _ S AY D _ W IH DH _ T EH R ER .
She is now planning a visit. :: SH IY _ IH Z _ N AW _ P L AE N IH NG _ AH _ V IH Z AH T .
The prognosis is excellent. :: DH AH _ P R AA G N OW S AH S _ IH Z _ EH K S AH L AH N T .
Each one has its own system. :: IY CH _ W AH N _ HH AE Z _ IH T S _ OW N _ S IH S T AH M .
We are still getting signals. :: W IY _ AA R _ S T IH L _ G EH T IH NG _ S IH G N AH L Z .
I heard some of his remarks. :: AY _ HH ER D _ S AH M _ AH V _ HH IH Z _ R IH M AA R K S .
So we will cut their numbers. :: S OW _ W IY _ W IH L _ K AH T _ DH EH R _ N AH M B ER Z .
I guess it is down to focus. :: AY _ G EH S _ IH T _ IH Z _ D AW N _ T UW _ F OW K AH S .
And there is no cause for it. :: AH N D _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ K AA Z _ F AO R _ IH T .
This is it finally finished. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ IH T _ F AY N AH L IY _ F IH N IH SH T .
That could run into millions. :: DH AE T _ K UH D _ R AH N _ IH N T UW _ M IH L Y AH N Z .
But it was money well spent. :: B AH T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ M AH N IY _ W EH L _ S P EH N T .
Everything was up for grabs. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ W AA Z _ AH P _ F AO R _ G R AE B Z .
Now you see him, now you don't. :: N AW _ Y UW _ S IY _ HH IH M , N AW _ Y UW _ D OW N T .
I'm getting long in the tooth. :: AY M _ G EH T IH NG _ L AO NG _ IH N _ DH AH _ T UW TH .
It is a very special place. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ S P EH SH AH L _ P L EY S .
Nobody could survive on that. :: N OW B AA D IY _ K UH D _ S ER V AY V _ AA N _ DH AE T .
This will be no easy option. :: DH IH S _ W IH L _ B IY _ N OW _ IY Z IY _ AA P SH AH N .
He is doing the right things. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ D UW IH NG _ DH AH _ R AY T _ TH IH NG Z .
Frustration is not the word. :: F R AH S T R EY SH AH N _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ W ER D .
He's also thinking long-term. :: HH IY Z _ AO L S OW _ TH IH NG K IH NG _ L AO NG T ER M .
This could be her way forward. :: DH IH S _ K UH D _ B IY _ HH ER _ W EY _ F AO R W ER D .
They hold on for many years. :: DH EY _ HH OW L D _ AA N _ F AO R _ M EH N IY _ Y IH R Z .
It doesn't look good for her. :: IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ L UH K _ G UH D _ F AO R _ HH ER .
Thereafter he left Scotland. :: DH EH R AE F T ER _ HH IY _ L EH F T _ S K AA T L AH N D .
Club rugby refuses to die. :: K L AH B _ R AH G B IY _ R AH F Y UW Z AH Z _ T UW _ D AY .
It is having a big impact. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH AE V IH NG _ AH _ B IH G _ IH M P AE K T .
We are taking it seriously. :: W IY _ AA R _ T EY K IH NG _ IH T _ S IH R IY AH S L IY .
He had reason to be pleased. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ R IY Z AH N _ T UW _ B IY _ P L IY Z D .
I thought they played very well. :: AY _ TH AO T _ DH EY _ P L EY D _ V EH R IY _ W EH L .
This is an appealing record. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AE N _ AH P IY L IH NG _ R AH K AO R D .
We know we have the quality. :: W IY _ N OW _ W IY _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ K W AA L AH T IY .
I am not going to sit back. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ S IH T _ B AE K .
We spoke about a few people. :: W IY _ S P OW K _ AH B AW T _ AH _ F Y UW _ P IY P AH L .
What you sow, you have to reap. :: W AH T _ Y UW _ S AW , Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ R IY P .
He was part of the family. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ P AA R T _ AH V _ DH AH _ F AE M AH L IY .
But that is for another day. :: B AH T _ DH AE T _ IH Z _ F AO R _ AH N AH DH ER _ D EY .
So what was he really doing? :: S OW _ W AH T _ W AA Z _ HH IY _ R IH L IY _ D UW IH NG ?
I don't want to go anywhere. :: AY _ D OW N T _ W AA N T _ T UW _ G OW _ EH N IY W EH R .
We have got to deal with it. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ T UW _ D IY L _ W IH DH _ IH T .
They are looking for partners. :: DH EY _ AA R _ L UH K IH NG _ F AO R _ P AA R T N ER Z .
It will not happen overnight. :: IH T _ W IH L _ N AA T _ HH AE P AH N _ OW V ER N AY T .
We might never see him again. :: W IY _ M AY T _ N EH V ER _ S IY _ HH IH M _ AH G EH N .
The government agreed to pay. :: DH AH _ G AH V ER M AH N T _ AH G R IY D _ T UW _ P EY .
He said nothing of the sort. :: HH IY _ S EH D _ N AH TH IH NG _ AH V _ DH AH _ S AO R T .
We've got a full house tonight. :: W IY V _ G AA T _ AH _ F UH L _ HH AW S _ T AH N AY T .
That gave us some confidence. :: DH AE T _ G EY V _ AH S _ S AH M _ K AA N F AH D AH N S .
I will report in the spring. :: AY _ W IH L _ R IY P AO R T _ IH N _ DH AH _ S P R IH NG .
But we can't have a casino. :: B AH T _ W IY _ K AE N T _ HH AE V _ AH _ K AH S IY N OW .
But not all were so defiant. :: B AH T _ N AA T _ AO L _ W ER _ S OW _ D IH F AY AH N T .
We will need to look at that. :: W IY _ W IH L _ N IY D _ T UW _ L UH K _ AE T _ DH AE T .
Sadly, they don't seem to know. :: S AE D L IY , DH EY _ D OW N T _ S IY M _ T UW _ N OW .
Now he is in charge of this. :: N AW _ HH IY _ IH Z _ IH N _ CH AA R JH _ AH V _ DH IH S .

Our message is getting through. :: AW ER _ M EH S AH JH _ IH Z _ G EH T IH NG _ TH R UW .
But there is no easy option. :: B AH T _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ IY Z IY _ AA P SH AH N .
It is harder than you think. :: IH T _ IH Z _ HH AA R D ER _ DH AE N _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K .
I have never been unemployed. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N EH V ER _ B IH N _ AH N EH M P L OY D .
Pakistan denied the report. :: P AE K IH S T AE N _ D IH N AY D _ DH AH _ R IY P AO R T .
There will be no backing down. :: DH EH R _ W IH L _ B IY _ N OW _ B AE K IH NG _ D AW N .
But we need to keep it there. :: B AH T _ W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ K IY P _ IH T _ DH EH R .
It just got out of control. :: IH T _ JH AH S T _ G AA T _ AW T _ AH V _ K AH N T R OW L .
It could have been prevented. :: IH T _ K UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ P R IH V EH N T IH D .
This is a big game for them. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ B IH G _ G EY M _ F AO R _ DH EH M .

I'm not interested in money. :: AY M _ N AA T _ IH N T R AH S T AH D _ IH N _ M AH N IY .
It was a definite penalty. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ D EH F AH N AH T _ P EH N AH L T IY .
I was the willing journeyman. :: AY _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ W IH L IH NG _ JH ER N IY M AE N .
and their remit is limited. :: AH N D _ DH EH R _ R IY M IH T _ IH Z _ L IH M AH T AH D .
I wonder what they listen to? :: AY _ W AH N D ER _ W AH T _ DH EY _ L IH S AH N _ T UW ?
Clearly, it can go either way. :: K L IH R L IY , IH T _ K AE N _ G OW _ IY DH ER _ W EY .

We have to keep our clients. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ K IY P _ AW ER _ K L AY AH N T S .
This is absolutely not true. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AE B S AH L UW T L IY _ N AA T _ T R UW .
And we have the experience. :: AH N D _ W IY _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ IH K S P IH R IY AH N S .
We didn't want any trouble. :: W IY _ D IH D AH N T _ W AA N T _ EH N IY _ T R AH B AH L .
Perhaps we should do the same. :: P ER HH AE P S _ W IY _ SH UH D _ D UW _ DH AH _ S EY M .
Banking stocks were hit hard. :: B AE NG K IH NG _ S T AA K S _ W ER _ HH IH T _ HH AA R D .
It used to be all hard sell. :: IH T _ Y UW Z D _ T UW _ B IY _ AO L _ HH AA R D _ S EH L .
It seems a good thing to try. :: IH T _ S IY M Z _ AH _ G UH D _ TH IH NG _ T UW _ T R AY .
But the New Year was special. :: B AH T _ DH AH _ N UW _ Y IH R _ W AA Z _ S P EH SH AH L .
You should try to have a laugh. :: Y UW _ SH UH D _ T R AY _ T UW _ HH AE V _ AH _ L AE F .
I learned that only yesterday. :: AY _ L ER N D _ DH AE T _ OW N L IY _ Y EH S T ER D EY .
That is a crazy situation. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AH _ K R EY Z IY _ S IH CH UW EY SH AH N .
I said that I had been raped. :: AY _ S EH D _ DH AE T _ AY _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ R EY P T .
The teacher would have approved. :: DH AH _ T IY CH ER _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ AH P R UW V D .
There were a lot of emotions. :: DH EH R _ W ER _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ IH M OW SH AH N Z .
That argument has been won. :: DH AE T _ AA R G Y AH M AH N T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ W AH N .
He is at peace with himself. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AE T _ P IY S _ W IH DH _ HH IH M S EH L F .
London remained the favourite. :: L AH N D AH N _ R IH M EY N D _ DH AH _ F EY V ER IH T .

They will now remain split up. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ N AW _ R IH M EY N _ S P L IH T _ AH P .
We are on the path of change. :: W IY _ AA R _ AA N _ DH AH _ P AE TH _ AH V _ CH EY N JH .
I had come back from London. :: AY _ HH AE D _ K AH M _ B AE K _ F R AH M _ L AH N D AH N .

That was around July, August. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ ER AW N D _ JH UW L AY , AA G AH S T .
No, because they look good boys. :: N OW , B IH K AO Z _ DH EY _ L UH K _ G UH D _ B OY Z .
They have created a business. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ K R IY EY T AH D _ AH _ B IH Z N AH S .
Bin Laden was not mentioned. :: B IH N _ L EY D AH N _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ M EH N SH AH N D .
Do not forget about Monaco. :: D UW _ N AA T _ F ER G EH T _ AH B AW T _ M AA N AH K OW .

Have we not been here before? :: HH AE V _ W IY _ N AA T _ B IH N _ HH IY R _ B IH F AO R ?
It's a way of making a mark. :: IH T S _ AH _ W EY _ AH V _ M EY K IH NG _ AH _ M AA R K .
But one shouldn't go by that. :: B AH T _ W AH N _ SH UH D AH N T _ G OW _ B AY _ DH AE T .
Eleven events are required. :: IH L EH V AH N _ IH V EH N T S _ AA R _ R IY K W AY ER D .
I can't wait for the outdoors. :: AY _ K AE N T _ W EY T _ F AO R _ DH AH _ AW T D AO R Z .
You have to go to the edges. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G OW _ T UW _ DH AH _ EH JH AH Z .

I ran to get out of the way. :: AY _ R AE N _ T UW _ G EH T _ AW T _ AH V _ DH AH _ W EY .
Do you think you have a shot? :: D UW _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K _ Y UW _ HH AE V _ AH _ SH AA T ?
He saw it all as a big game. :: HH IY _ S AO _ IH T _ AO L _ AE Z _ AH _ B IH G _ G EY M .
I feel privileged to be here. :: AY _ F IY L _ P R IH V L AH JH D _ T UW _ B IY _ HH IY R .
I went straight to the toilet. :: AY _ W EH N T _ S T R EY T _ T UW _ DH AH _ T OY L AH T .
I took a minibus into town. :: AY _ T UH K _ AH _ M IH N IY B AH S _ IH N T UW _ T AW N .
All were paid by the taxpayer. :: AO L _ W ER _ P EY D _ B AY _ DH AH _ T AE K S P EY ER .
The fund has three elements. :: DH AH _ F AH N D _ HH AE Z _ TH R IY _ EH L AH M AH N T S .
But we're not the same person. :: B AH T _ W IY R _ N AA T _ DH AH _ S EY M _ P ER S AH N .
There are nine people here now. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ N AY N _ P IY P AH L _ HH IY R _ N AW .
That nation is South Africa. :: DH AE T _ N EY SH AH N _ IH Z _ S AW TH _ AE F R AH K AH .
It was an empowering journey. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ IH M P AW ER IH NG _ JH ER N IY .
Everything has been destroyed. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ D IH S T R OY D .
Partition is not an option. :: P AA R T IH SH AH N _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AE N _ AA P SH AH N .
It is a very special city. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ S P EH SH AH L _ S IH T IY .
She said he showed no remorse. :: SH IY _ S EH D _ HH IY _ SH OW D _ N OW _ R IH M AO R S .
My friends were very envious. :: M AY _ F R EH N D Z _ W ER _ V EH R IY _ EH N V IY AH S .
She was only doing her job. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ OW N L IY _ D UW IH NG _ HH ER _ JH AA B .
The matter will come up again. :: DH AH _ M AE T ER _ W IH L _ K AH M _ AH P _ AH G EH N .
Yes, it was too short a night. :: Y EH S , IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ SH AO R T _ AH _ N AY T .
There wasn't anything in it. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z AH N T _ EH N IY TH IH NG _ IH N _ IH T .
I doubt it would be genuine. :: AY _ D AW T _ IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ JH EH N Y AH W AH N .
We've still got a say in this. :: W IY V _ S T IH L _ G AA T _ AH _ S EY _ IH N _ DH IH S .
I think it is totally wrong. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T _ IH Z _ T OW T AH L IY _ R AO NG .
That is why it's so lyrical. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ W AY _ IH T S _ S OW _ L IH R IH K AH L .
We have to defend ourselves. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ D IH F EH N D _ AW ER S EH L V Z .
The kids are paying the price. :: DH AH _ K IH D Z _ AA R _ P EY IH NG _ DH AH _ P R AY S .
He never asked me for money. :: HH IY _ N EH V ER _ AE S K T _ M IY _ F AO R _ M AH N IY .
Perhaps it was her demeanour. :: P ER HH AE P S _ IH T _ W AA Z _ HH ER _ D IH M IY N ER .
It is the icing on the cake. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ AY S IH NG _ AA N _ DH AH _ K EY K .
Who will take them after that? :: HH UW _ W IH L _ T EY K _ DH EH M _ AE F T ER _ DH AE T ?
We are keen to have him back. :: W IY _ AA R _ K IY N _ T UW _ HH AE V _ HH IH M _ B AE K .
It helped me to get noticed. :: IH T _ HH EH L P T _ M IY _ T UW _ G EH T _ N OW T AH S T .
We offered something different. :: W IY _ AO F ER D _ S AH M TH IH NG _ D IH F ER AH N T .
Frank Warren is a great man. :: F R AE NG K _ W AO R AH N _ IH Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ M AE N .
That was never their agenda. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ N EH V ER _ DH EH R _ AH JH EH N D AH .
Would they work together again? :: W UH D _ DH EY _ W ER K _ T AH G EH DH ER _ AH G EH N ?
This is not a war on terror. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ W AO R _ AA N _ T EH R ER .
It is all up to the Members. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AO L _ AH P _ T UW _ DH AH _ M EH M B ER Z .
We are aware of the problem. :: W IY _ AA R _ AH W EH R _ AH V _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
He knows what he's got to do. :: HH IY _ N OW Z _ W AH T _ HH IY Z _ G AA T _ T UW _ D UW .
It has to reinvent itself. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ R IY IH N V EH N T _ IH T S EH L F .
He was happy with his form. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ HH AE P IY _ W IH DH _ HH IH Z _ F AO R M .
That just wasn't good enough. :: DH AE T _ JH AH S T _ W AA Z AH N T _ G UH D _ IH N AH F .
I think we're very different. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ W IY R _ V EH R IY _ D IH F ER AH N T .
It helped to get me noticed. :: IH T _ HH EH L P T _ T UW _ G EH T _ M IY _ N OW T AH S T .
Later they changed their minds. :: L EY T ER _ DH EY _ CH EY N JH D _ DH EH R _ M AY N D Z .
There we were on the first tee. :: DH EH R _ W IY _ W ER _ AA N _ DH AH _ F ER S T _ T IY .
He didn't have long to wait. :: HH IY _ D IH D AH N T _ HH AE V _ L AO NG _ T UW _ W EY T .
She's now on the back benches. :: SH IY Z _ N AW _ AA N _ DH AH _ B AE K _ B EH N CH IH Z .
I want to help other women. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ HH EH L P _ AH DH ER _ W IH M AH N .
I have no problem with that. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N OW _ P R AA B L AH M _ W IH DH _ DH AE T .
We know we can't rely on you. :: W IY _ N OW _ W IY _ K AE N T _ R IH L AY _ AA N _ Y UW .
It may be the first of many. :: IH T _ M EY _ B IY _ DH AH _ F ER S T _ AH V _ M EH N IY .
It is just a matter of time. :: IH T _ IH Z _ JH AH S T _ AH _ M AE T ER _ AH V _ T AY M .
He loved it, and so did they. :: HH IY _ L AH V D _ IH T , AH N D _ S OW _ D IH D _ DH EY .
He almost admitted as much. :: HH IY _ AO L M OW S T _ AH D M IH T AH D _ AE Z _ M AH CH .
And it worked, so we kept it. :: AH N D _ IH T _ W ER K T , S OW _ W IY _ K EH P T _ IH T .
Thankfully it was cleared up. :: TH AE NG K F AH L IY _ IH T _ W AA Z _ K L IH R D _ AH P .
They were very unfair to him. :: DH EY _ W ER _ V EH R IY _ AH N F EH R _ T UW _ HH IH M .
She has not returned to work. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ R IH T ER N D _ T UW _ W ER K .
You've got to fight to stay up. :: Y UW V _ G AA T _ T UW _ F AY T _ T UW _ S T EY _ AH P .
I don't believe a word of it. :: AY _ D OW N T _ B IH L IY V _ AH _ W ER D _ AH V _ IH T .
And therein lies the problem. :: AH N D _ DH EH R IH N _ L AY Z _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
But, still, it wasn't working. :: B AH T , S T IH L , IH T _ W AA Z AH N T _ W ER K IH NG .
It was extremely difficult. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ D IH F AH K AH L T .
We couldn't get enough of it. :: W IY _ K UH D AH N T _ G EH T _ IH N AH F _ AH V _ IH T .
The game was there to be won. :: DH AH _ G EY M _ W AA Z _ DH EH R _ T UW _ B IY _ W AH N .
It just could be a good night. :: IH T _ JH AH S T _ K UH D _ B IY _ AH _ G UH D _ N AY T .
And that was just the start. :: AH N D _ DH AE T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ DH AH _ S T AA R T .
Not that he was complaining. :: N AA T _ DH AE T _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ K AH M P L EY N IH NG .
I don't think it's very real. :: AY _ D OW N T _ TH IH NG K _ IH T S _ V EH R IY _ R IY L .
Yes, it took time to recover. :: Y EH S , IH T _ T UH K _ T AY M _ T UW _ R IH K AH V ER .
The progress has been steady. :: DH AH _ P R AA G R EH S _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ S T EH D IY .
I don't think it's the area. :: AY _ D OW N T _ TH IH NG K _ IH T S _ DH AH _ EH R IY AH .
I really had to concentrate. :: AY _ R IH L IY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ K AA N S AH N T R EY T .
I have not had much of him. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ HH AE D _ M AH CH _ AH V _ HH IH M .
One was taken to hospital. :: W AH N _ W AA Z _ T EY K AH N _ T UW _ HH AA S P IH T AH L .
Mr Wallace was unimpressed. :: M IH S T ER _ W AO L AH S _ W AA Z _ AH N IH M P R EH S T .
The hearing continues today. :: DH AH _ HH IY R IH NG _ K AH N T IH N Y UW Z _ T AH D EY .
It was all over for us then. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AO L _ OW V ER _ F AO R _ AH S _ DH EH N .
It really is good to be back. :: IH T _ R IH L IY _ IH Z _ G UH D _ T UW _ B IY _ B AE K .
We were unlucky not to score. :: W IY _ W ER _ AH N L AH K IY _ N AA T _ T UW _ S K AO R .
It is a job creation scheme. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ JH AA B _ K R IY EY SH AH N _ S K IY M .
Neither side can win this war. :: N IY DH ER _ S AY D _ K AE N _ W IH N _ DH IH S _ W AO R .
It's all change at Kilmarnock. :: IH T S _ AO L _ CH EY N JH _ AE T _ K IH L M AA R N AA K .
It wasn't a flight of fancy. :: IH T _ W AA Z AH N T _ AH _ F L AY T _ AH V _ F AE N S IY .
That time is not now, however. :: DH AE T _ T AY M _ IH Z _ N AA T _ N AW , HH AW EH V ER .
It's a mixture of everything. :: IH T S _ AH _ M IH K S CH ER _ AH V _ EH V R IY TH IH NG .
It happens from time to time. :: IH T _ HH AE P AH N Z _ F R AH M _ T AY M _ T UW _ T AY M .
This is a war over our home. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ W AO R _ OW V ER _ AW ER _ HH OW M .
No, the equipment is extra. :: N OW , DH AH _ IH K W IH P M AH N T _ IH Z _ EH K S T R AH .
He must get to know himself. :: HH IY _ M AH S T _ G EH T _ T UW _ N OW _ HH IH M S EH L F .
Do I think about them often? :: D UW _ AY _ TH IH NG K _ AH B AW T _ DH EH M _ AO F AH N ?
In the old days, it was easy. :: IH N _ DH AH _ OW L D _ D EY Z , IH T _ W AA Z _ IY Z IY .
We are encouraged by the news. :: W IY _ AA R _ EH N K ER IH JH D _ B AY _ DH AH _ N UW Z .
I don't want to use the term. :: AY _ D OW N T _ W AA N T _ T UW _ Y UW S _ DH AH _ T ER M .
We had a reunion last week. :: W IY _ HH AE D _ AH _ R IY UW N Y AH N _ L AE S T _ W IY K .
But it took a lot of bottle. :: B AH T _ IH T _ T UH K _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ B AA T AH L .
Abbey National is an option. :: AE B IY _ N AE SH AH N AH L _ IH Z _ AE N _ AA P SH AH N .
This is a successful outcome. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ S AH K S EH S F AH L _ AW T K AH M .
I was caught out a little bit. :: AY _ W AA Z _ K AA T _ AW T _ AH _ L IH T AH L _ B IH T .
In that moment, I was happy. :: IH N _ DH AE T _ M OW M AH N T , AY _ W AA Z _ HH AE P IY .
He could face a jail sentence. :: HH IY _ K UH D _ F EY S _ AH _ JH EY L _ S EH N T AH N S .

Once again, they would be wrong. :: W AH N S _ AH G EH N , DH EY _ W UH D _ B IY _ R AO NG .
My aim is a top six finish. :: M AY _ EY M _ IH Z _ AH _ T AA P _ S IH K S _ F IH N IH SH .
I was in jail for five years. :: AY _ W AA Z _ IH N _ JH EY L _ F AO R _ F AY V _ Y IH R Z .
It is based on a true story. :: IH T _ IH Z _ B EY S T _ AA N _ AH _ T R UW _ S T AO R IY .
The players were under pressure. :: DH AH _ P L EY ER Z _ W ER _ AH N D ER _ P R EH SH ER .
They have to get that sorted. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G EH T _ DH AE T _ S AO R T IH D .
That was the case with David. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ K EY S _ W IH DH _ D EY V IH D .
This is the interesting part. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ IH N T R AH S T IH NG _ P AA R T .
That was the difference today. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ D IH F ER AH N S _ T AH D EY .
He could do nothing about it. :: HH IY _ K UH D _ D UW _ N AH TH IH NG _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
Death is outside the language. :: D EH TH _ IH Z _ AW T S AY D _ DH AH _ L AE NG G W AH JH .
It certainly appeared that way. :: IH T _ S ER T AH N L IY _ AH P IH R D _ DH AE T _ W EY .
I am relishing the challenge. :: AY _ AE M _ R EH L IH SH IH NG _ DH AH _ CH AE L AH N JH .
This Patton will also return. :: DH IH S _ P AE T AH N _ W IH L _ AO L S OW _ R IH T ER N .

We'll have to work hard today. :: W IY L _ HH AE V _ T UW _ W ER K _ HH AA R D _ T AH D EY .
The whole thing is the music. :: DH AH _ HH OW L _ TH IH NG _ IH Z _ DH AH _ M Y UW Z IH K .
It's fantastic to win again. :: IH T S _ F AE N T AE S T IH K _ T UW _ W IH N _ AH G EH N .
There is a lack of chemistry. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ L AE K _ AH V _ K EH M AH S T R IY .
I'm so worried about the roads. :: AY M _ S OW _ W ER IY D _ AH B AW T _ DH AH _ R OW D Z .
It was like someone had died. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ L AY K _ S AH M W AH N _ HH AE D _ D AY D .
He certainly did a good job! :: HH IY _ S ER T AH N L IY _ D IH D _ AH _ G UH D _ JH AA B !
It was clearly not a battle. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K L IH R L IY _ N AA T _ AH _ B AE T AH L .
He followed the Italian route. :: HH IY _ F AA L OW D _ DH AH _ IH T AE L Y AH N _ R UW T .
It's just an area of water. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ AE N _ EH R IY AH _ AH V _ W AO T ER .

It's just one of those things. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ W AH N _ AH V _ DH OW Z _ TH IH NG Z .

We need to be more specific. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ B IY _ M AO R _ S P AH S IH F IH K .
About time too, you might think. :: AH B AW T _ T AY M _ T UW , Y UW _ M AY T _ TH IH NG K .
Some injustice was committed. :: S AH M _ IH N JH AH S T IH S _ W AA Z _ K AH M IH T AH D .
And it's difficult to argue. :: AH N D _ IH T S _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ T UW _ AA R G Y UW .

But then the problems began. :: B AH T _ DH EH N _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M Z _ B IH G AE N .
That's a very serious matter. :: DH AE T S _ AH _ V EH R IY _ S IH R IY AH S _ M AE T ER .
Sad to say, it's still waiting. :: S AE D _ T UW _ S EY , IH T S _ S T IH L _ W EY T IH NG .

It hasn't worked out that way. :: IH T _ HH AE Z AH N T _ W ER K T _ AW T _ DH AE T _ W EY .
Little girls are his victims. :: L IH T AH L _ G ER L Z _ AA R _ HH IH Z _ V IH K T AH M Z .

His is a global perspective. :: HH IH Z _ IH Z _ AH _ G L OW B AH L _ P ER S P EH K T IH V .
He should emerge as the winner. :: HH IY _ SH UH D _ IH M ER JH _ AE Z _ DH AH _ W IH N ER .
We have the moral high ground. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ M AO R AH L _ HH AY _ G R AW N D .

That can cost him a fortune. :: DH AE T _ K AE N _ K AA S T _ HH IH M _ AH _ F AO R CH AH N .
As if that is an achievement. :: AE Z _ IH F _ DH AE T _ IH Z _ AE N _ AH CH IY V M AH N T .

It would be easy to think so. :: IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ IY Z IY _ T UW _ TH IH NG K _ S OW .
It should have its own network. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ HH AE V _ IH T S _ OW N _ N EH T W ER K .
That shows the impact it had. :: DH AE T _ SH OW Z _ DH AH _ IH M P AE K T _ IH T _ HH AE D .

It's not one for the purist. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ W AH N _ F AO R _ DH AH _ P Y UH R IH S T .
We are taking advice on this. :: W IY _ AA R _ T EY K IH NG _ AE D V AY S _ AA N _ DH IH S .
But we have come under attack. :: B AH T _ W IY _ HH AE V _ K AH M _ AH N D ER _ AH T AE K .
We are here for the long term. :: W IY _ AA R _ HH IY R _ F AO R _ DH AH _ L AO NG _ T ER M .
There are exciting days ahead. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ IH K S AY T IH NG _ D EY Z _ AH HH EH D .
Within three days he was dead. :: W IH DH IH N _ TH R IY _ D EY Z _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ D EH D .
It is part of our heritage. :: IH T _ IH Z _ P AA R T _ AH V _ AW ER _ HH EH R AH T AH JH .
How do we get a bigger stage? :: HH AW _ D UW _ W IY _ G EH T _ AH _ B IH G ER _ S T EY JH ?
But it's not just about that. :: B AH T _ IH T S _ N AA T _ JH AH S T _ AH B AW T _ DH AE T .
But someone has to take them. :: B AH T _ S AH M W AH N _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ T EY K _ DH EH M .
Would she remember the music? :: W UH D _ SH IY _ R IH M EH M B ER _ DH AH _ M Y UW Z IH K ?
It is time to be realistic. :: IH T _ IH Z _ T AY M _ T UW _ B IY _ R IY AH L IH S T IH K .
This is a terrible tragedy. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ T EH R AH B AH L _ T R AE JH AH D IY .
He was not entirely correct. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ IH N T AY ER L IY _ K ER EH K T .
It's a difficult one to play. :: IH T S _ AH _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ W AH N _ T UW _ P L EY .
And there is another problem. :: AH N D _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH N AH DH ER _ P R AA B L AH M .
There is nothing they can't do. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ DH EY _ K AE N T _ D UW .
It was like being in prison. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ L AY K _ B IY IH NG _ IH N _ P R IH Z AH N .
They were just too good for us. :: DH EY _ W ER _ JH AH S T _ T UW _ G UH D _ F AO R _ AH S .
He would not have to explain. :: HH IY _ W UH D _ N AA T _ HH AE V _ T UW _ IH K S P L EY N .
They couldn't keep it together. :: DH EY _ K UH D AH N T _ K IY P _ IH T _ T AH G EH DH ER .
Was the punishment excessive? :: W AA Z _ DH AH _ P AH N IH SH M AH N T _ IH K S EH S IH V ?
Maintain the highest standards. :: M EY N T EY N _ DH AH _ HH AY AH S T _ S T AE N D ER D Z .
It just never comes together. :: IH T _ JH AH S T _ N EH V ER _ K AH M Z _ T AH G EH DH ER .
It will be a huge difference. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ AH _ HH Y UW JH _ D IH F ER AH N S .
For me, any manager is good. :: F AO R _ M IY , EH N IY _ M AE N AH JH ER _ IH Z _ G UH D .
I am really ready for it now. :: AY _ AE M _ R IH L IY _ R EH D IY _ F AO R _ IH T _ N AW .
That is the sensible outcome. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S EH N S AH B AH L _ AW T K AH M .
There was nothing she could do. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ SH IY _ K UH D _ D UW .
He will appear in court today. :: HH IY _ W IH L _ AH P IH R _ IH N _ K AO R T _ T AH D EY .
Only two players have done it. :: OW N L IY _ T UW _ P L EY ER Z _ HH AE V _ D AH N _ IH T .
There's a lot of it going on. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ IH T _ G OW IH NG _ AA N .
We have been extremely busy. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ B IH Z IY .
It's great fun to get to act. :: IH T S _ G R EY T _ F AH N _ T UW _ G EH T _ T UW _ AE K T .
I don't know them or anything. :: AY _ D OW N T _ N OW _ DH EH M _ AO R _ EH N IY TH IH NG .
But it has all been worthwhile. :: B AH T _ IH T _ HH AE Z _ AO L _ B IH N _ W ER TH W AY L .
It is almost like a family. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AO L M OW S T _ L AY K _ AH _ F AE M AH L IY .
Well, you can't have everything. :: W EH L , Y UW _ K AE N T _ HH AE V _ EH V R IY TH IH NG .
So what is the campaign about? :: S OW _ W AH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K AE M P EY N _ AH B AW T ?
We've made a couple of albums. :: W IY V _ M EY D _ AH _ K AH P AH L _ AH V _ AE L B AH M Z .
They were seriously after him. :: DH EY _ W ER _ S IH R IY AH S L IY _ AE F T ER _ HH IH M .
There is a world of difference. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ W ER L D _ AH V _ D IH F ER AH N S .
Kingfisher can afford to wait. :: K IH NG F IH SH ER _ K AE N _ AH F AO R D _ T UW _ W EY T .
Persuaded to change his mind. :: P ER S W EY D AH D _ T UW _ CH EY N JH _ HH IH Z _ M AY N D .
They will want to perform well. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ W AA N T _ T UW _ P ER F AO R M _ W EH L .
Eight months later, he was dead. :: EY T _ M AH N TH S _ L EY T ER , HH IY _ W AA Z _ D EH D .
The boy is no longer with us. :: DH AH _ B OY _ IH Z _ N OW _ L AO NG G ER _ W IH DH _ AH S .
We are looking for perfection. :: W IY _ AA R _ L UH K IH NG _ F AO R _ P ER F EH K SH AH N .
But he can turn on the charm. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ K AE N _ T ER N _ AA N _ DH AH _ CH AA R M .
We are the gateway to justice. :: W IY _ AA R _ DH AH _ G EY T W EY _ T UW _ JH AH S T AH S .
They are the innocent victims. :: DH EY _ AA R _ DH AH _ IH N AH S AH N T _ V IH K T AH M Z .
The case will now go to appeal. :: DH AH _ K EY S _ W IH L _ N AW _ G OW _ T UW _ AH P IY L .
He felt it was the right time. :: HH IY _ F EH L T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ R AY T _ T AY M .
A friendship that will endure. :: AH _ F R EH N D SH IH P _ DH AE T _ W IH L _ EH N D Y UH R .
The attacker died in the crash. :: DH AH _ AH T AE K ER _ D AY D _ IH N _ DH AH _ K R AE SH .
Three days later, he was killed. :: TH R IY _ D EY Z _ L EY T ER , HH IY _ W AA Z _ K IH L D .
He has defended the system. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ D IH F EH N D AH D _ DH AH _ S IH S T AH M .
Scotland won by six wickets. :: S K AA T L AH N D _ W AH N _ B AY _ S IH K S _ W IH K AH T S .
These people are not big names. :: DH IY Z _ P IY P AH L _ AA R _ N AA T _ B IH G _ N EY M Z .
We created so many chances. :: W IY _ K R IY EY T AH D _ S OW _ M EH N IY _ CH AE N S AH Z .
It is not a financial issue. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ F AH N AE N SH AH L _ IH SH UW .
She always wanted her own way. :: SH IY _ AO L W EY Z _ W AA N T AH D _ HH ER _ OW N _ W EY .
This is a question of Islam. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ K W EH S CH AH N _ AH V _ IH S L AA M .
They seem to get away with it. :: DH EY _ S IY M _ T UW _ G EH T _ AH W EY _ W IH DH _ IH T .
There was a fine line to tread. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ F AY N _ L AY N _ T UW _ T R EH D .
This should come as no surprise. :: DH IH S _ SH UH D _ K AH M _ AE Z _ N OW _ S ER P R AY Z .
IT S the real thing, for sure. :: IH T _ EH S _ DH AH _ R IY L _ TH IH NG , F AO R _ SH UH R .
You are not allowed to do that. :: Y UW _ AA R _ N AA T _ AH L AW D _ T UW _ D UW _ DH AE T .
This is a game of confidence. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ G EY M _ AH V _ K AA N F AH D AH N S .
This isn't the end of story. :: DH IH S _ IH Z AH N T _ DH AH _ EH N D _ AH V _ S T AO R IY .
That is the ultimate revenge. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ AH L T AH M AH T _ R IY V EH N JH .
Job losses were also announced. :: JH AA B _ L AO S AH Z _ W ER _ AO L S OW _ AH N AW N S T .
Other people had looked at it. :: AH DH ER _ P IY P AH L _ HH AE D _ L UH K T _ AE T _ IH T .
He said something in his work. :: HH IY _ S EH D _ S AH M TH IH NG _ IH N _ HH IH Z _ W ER K .
That should get their attention. :: DH AE T _ SH UH D _ G EH T _ DH EH R _ AH T EH N SH AH N .
The countryside is in crisis. :: DH AH _ K AH N T R IY S AY D _ IH Z _ IH N _ K R AY S AH S .
The next few months will tell. :: DH AH _ N EH K S T _ F Y UW _ M AH N TH S _ W IH L _ T EH L .
Consumers will also benefit. :: K AH N S UW M ER Z _ W IH L _ AO L S OW _ B EH N AH F IH T .
Britain's role was to stop it. :: B R IH T AH N Z _ R OW L _ W AA Z _ T UW _ S T AA P _ IH T .
I did let myself down a bit. :: AY _ D IH D _ L EH T _ M AY S EH L F _ D AW N _ AH _ B IH T .
He was a great human being. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ HH Y UW M AH N _ B IY IH NG .
Next league matches Kilmarnock. :: N EH K S T _ L IY G _ M AE CH AH Z _ K IH L M AA R N AA K .
Five local people were injured. :: F AY V _ L OW K AH L _ P IY P AH L _ W ER _ IH N JH ER D .
It should be a great game, though. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY _ AH _ G R EY T _ G EY M , DH OW .
Nobody said it was required. :: N OW B AA D IY _ S EH D _ IH T _ W AA Z _ R IY K W AY ER D .
It is not over by any means. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ OW V ER _ B AY _ EH N IY _ M IY N Z .
Mentally, you have to be tough. :: M EH N T AH L IY , Y UW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ B IY _ T AH F .
There is a range of employers. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ R EY N JH _ AH V _ EH M P L OY ER Z .
The savings can be dramatic. :: DH AH _ S EY V IH NG Z _ K AE N _ B IY _ D R AH M AE T IH K .
Had this been common practice? :: HH AE D _ DH IH S _ B IH N _ K AA M AH N _ P R AE K T AH S ?
It changed the very language. :: IH T _ CH EY N JH D _ DH AH _ V EH R IY _ L AE NG G W AH JH .
Her father had died recently. :: HH ER _ F AA DH ER _ HH AE D _ D AY D _ R IY S AH N T L IY .
Colin Cameron was excellent. :: K OW L IH N _ K AE M ER AH N _ W AA Z _ EH K S AH L AH N T .
They finished second and third. :: DH EY _ F IH N IH SH T _ S EH K AH N D _ AH N D _ TH ER D .
Something has to give sometime. :: S AH M TH IH NG _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ G IH V _ S AH M T AY M .
People will see this over time. :: P IY P AH L _ W IH L _ S IY _ DH IH S _ OW V ER _ T AY M .
I was pleased with my own game. :: AY _ W AA Z _ P L IY Z D _ W IH DH _ M AY _ OW N _ G EY M .
His message was very simple. :: HH IH Z _ M EH S AH JH _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ S IH M P AH L .
Funding needs to be long term. :: F AH N D IH NG _ N IY D Z _ T UW _ B IY _ L AO NG _ T ER M .
On my day I can beat anyone. :: AA N _ M AY _ D EY _ AY _ K AE N _ B IY T _ EH N IY W AH N .
Our future is in their hands. :: AW ER _ F Y UW CH ER _ IH Z _ IH N _ DH EH R _ HH AE N D Z .
Our approach will be different. :: AW ER _ AH P R OW CH _ W IH L _ B IY _ D IH F ER AH N T .
I have no conflict with them. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N OW _ K AA N F L IH K T _ W IH DH _ DH EH M .
Could they perhaps be related? :: K UH D _ DH EY _ P ER HH AE P S _ B IY _ R IH L EY T IH D ?
I can live with just the one. :: AY _ K AE N _ L AY V _ W IH DH _ JH AH S T _ DH AH _ W AH N .
The men are safe and unharmed. :: DH AH _ M EH N _ AA R _ S EY F _ AH N D _ AH N HH AA R M D .
It may not even be possible. :: IH T _ M EY _ N AA T _ IY V IH N _ B IY _ P AA S AH B AH L .
We need to know more about her. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ N OW _ M AO R _ AH B AW T _ HH ER .
It was seriously unpleasant. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S IH R IY AH S L IY _ AH N P L EH Z AH N T .
The atmosphere is businesslike. :: DH AH _ AE T M AH S F IH R _ IH Z _ B IH Z N IH S L AY K .
How do we get more people in? :: HH AW _ D UW _ W IY _ G EH T _ M AO R _ P IY P AH L _ IH N ?
That is how it will be judged. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ HH AW _ IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ JH AH JH D .
How do you find the youngsters? :: HH AW _ D UW _ Y UW _ F AY N D _ DH AH _ Y AH NG S T ER Z ?
A lot of people were in tears. :: AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ P IY P AH L _ W ER _ IH N _ T EH R Z .
But first it goes out on TV. :: B AH T _ F ER S T _ IH T _ G OW Z _ AW T _ AA N _ T IY V IY .
I have learned a lot from him. :: AY _ HH AE V _ L ER N D _ AH _ L AA T _ F R AH M _ HH IH M .
It was created by genocide. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ K R IY EY T AH D _ B AY _ JH EH N AH S AY D .
Is this new report the answer? :: IH Z _ DH IH S _ N UW _ R IY P AO R T _ DH AH _ AE N S ER ?
Construction would then begin. :: K AH N S T R AH K SH AH N _ W UH D _ DH EH N _ B IH G IH N .
The final stage is paranoia. :: DH AH _ F AY N AH L _ S T EY JH _ IH Z _ P EH R AH N OY AH .
I am not putting myself down. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ P AH T IH NG _ M AY S EH L F _ D AW N .
We were lucky to have survived. :: W IY _ W ER _ L AH K IY _ T UW _ HH AE V _ S ER V AY V D .
My back is feeling really good. :: M AY _ B AE K _ IH Z _ F IY L IH NG _ R IH L IY _ G UH D .
It's totally double standards. :: IH T S _ T OW T AH L IY _ D AH B AH L _ S T AE N D ER D Z .
And then we got off the plane. :: AH N D _ DH EH N _ W IY _ G AA T _ AO F _ DH AH _ P L EY N .
We would all have liked to run. :: W IY _ W UH D _ AO L _ HH AE V _ L AY K T _ T UW _ R AH N .
Hopefully, now we're getting it. :: HH OW P F AH L IY , N AW _ W IY R _ G EH T IH NG _ IH T .
They responded with victories. :: DH EY _ R IH S P AA N D IH D _ W IH DH _ V IH K T ER IY Z .
Last year was not a good year. :: L AE S T _ Y IH R _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH _ G UH D _ Y IH R .
It happens in many countries. :: IH T _ HH AE P AH N Z _ IH N _ M EH N IY _ K AH N T R IY Z .
Someone else has now got them. :: S AH M W AH N _ EH L S _ HH AE Z _ N AW _ G AA T _ DH EH M .
He was part of South Africa. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ P AA R T _ AH V _ S AW TH _ AE F R AH K AH .
It had to be more flexible. :: IH T _ HH AE D _ T UW _ B IY _ M AO R _ F L EH K S AH B AH L .
It showed him the way to drive. :: IH T _ SH OW D _ HH IH M _ DH AH _ W EY _ T UW _ D R AY V .
It was very, very dejected. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY , V EH R IY _ D IH JH EH K T IH D .
This morning was very quiet. :: DH IH S _ M AO R N IH NG _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ K W AY AH T .
She's currently in foster care. :: SH IY Z _ K ER AH N T L IY _ IH N _ F AA S T ER _ K EH R .
We could learn a lot from them. :: W IY _ K UH D _ L ER N _ AH _ L AA T _ F R AH M _ DH EH M .
But then he changed his mind. :: B AH T _ DH EH N _ HH IY _ CH EY N JH D _ HH IH Z _ M AY N D .
It was a disaster of a race. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ D IH Z AE S T ER _ AH V _ AH _ R EY S .
He is also a great finisher. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ AO L S OW _ AH _ G R EY T _ F IH N IH SH ER .
And frankly, it's been a while. :: AH N D _ F R AE NG K L IY , IH T S _ B IH N _ AH _ W AY L .
None of the opinions is good. :: N AH N _ AH V _ DH AH _ AH P IH N Y AH N Z _ IH Z _ G UH D .
I am quite excited about it. :: AY _ AE M _ K W AY T _ IH K S AY T AH D _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
Whatever happened to that one? :: W AH T EH V ER _ HH AE P AH N D _ T UW _ DH AE T _ W AH N ?
And that is not a bad idea. :: AH N D _ DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ B AE D _ AY D IY AH .
What do you think of the hair? :: W AH T _ D UW _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K _ AH V _ DH AH _ HH EH R ?
It's not just a male agenda. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ JH AH S T _ AH _ M EY L _ AH JH EH N D AH .
He is involved in everything. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ IH N V AA L V D _ IH N _ EH V R IY TH IH NG .
They have worked with each other. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ W ER K T _ W IH DH _ IY CH _ AH DH ER .
It needs somebody to give way. :: IH T _ N IY D Z _ S AH M B AA D IY _ T UW _ G IH V _ W EY .
I get very excited by that. :: AY _ G EH T _ V EH R IY _ IH K S AY T AH D _ B AY _ DH AE T .
Maybe that was the whole point. :: M EY B IY _ DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ HH OW L _ P OY N T .
We can do nothing about that. :: W IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ N AH TH IH NG _ AH B AW T _ DH AE T .
That is how we will be judged. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ HH AW _ W IY _ W IH L _ B IY _ JH AH JH D .
I had no experience at all. :: AY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ IH K S P IH R IY AH N S _ AE T _ AO L .
I always liked to get a laugh. :: AY _ AO L W EY Z _ L AY K T _ T UW _ G EH T _ AH _ L AE F .
That question was never asked. :: DH AE T _ K W EH S CH AH N _ W AA Z _ N EH V ER _ AE S K T .
The other was a football match. :: DH AH _ AH DH ER _ W AA Z _ AH _ F UH T B AO L _ M AE CH .
But he was a really nice man. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ R IH L IY _ N AY S _ M AE N .
And that is very good indeed. :: AH N D _ DH AE T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ G UH D _ IH N D IY D .
I thought the dancing was over. :: AY _ TH AO T _ DH AH _ D AE N S IH NG _ W AA Z _ OW V ER .
It will be a new experience. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ AH _ N UW _ IH K S P IH R IY AH N S .
But he kept on repeating it. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ K EH P T _ AA N _ R IH P IY T IH NG _ IH T .
No one can say that about me. :: N OW _ W AH N _ K AE N _ S EY _ DH AE T _ AH B AW T _ M IY .
All the people here are local. :: AO L _ DH AH _ P IY P AH L _ HH IY R _ AA R _ L OW K AH L .
If you can work, you should work. :: IH F _ Y UW _ K AE N _ W ER K , Y UW _ SH UH D _ W ER K .
That must have had an effect. :: DH AE T _ M AH S T _ HH AE V _ HH AE D _ AE N _ IH F EH K T .
No, they are not the same thing. :: N OW , DH EY _ AA R _ N AA T _ DH AH _ S EY M _ TH IH NG .
It has still to be recovered. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ S T IH L _ T UW _ B IY _ R AH K AH V ER D .
The driver just insulted me. :: DH AH _ D R AY V ER _ JH AH S T _ IH N S AH L T IH D _ M IY .
Those are difficult decisions. :: DH OW Z _ AA R _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ D IH S IH ZH AH N Z .
This is positive and welcome. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ P AA Z AH T IH V _ AH N D _ W EH L K AH M .
You've got to hand it to them. :: Y UW V _ G AA T _ T UW _ HH AE N D _ IH T _ T UW _ DH EH M .
And that was just about that. :: AH N D _ DH AE T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AH B AW T _ DH AE T .
We are very, very confident. :: W IY _ AA R _ V EH R IY , V EH R IY _ K AA N F AH D AH N T .
That is not, however, the case. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T , HH AW EH V ER , DH AH _ K EY S .
That was a huge experience. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH Y UW JH _ IH K S P IH R IY AH N S .
We have a good healthy debate. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH _ G UH D _ HH EH L TH IY _ D AH B EY T .
There was no hint of scandal. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ HH IH N T _ AH V _ S K AE N D AH L .
Our decision making was poor. :: AW ER _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ M EY K IH NG _ W AA Z _ P UH R .
Had this been common practice? :: HH AE D _ DH IH S _ B IH N _ K AA M AH N _ P R AE K T AH S ?
It has been made to entertain. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ M EY D _ T UW _ EH N T ER T EY N .
In due course the deal was done. :: IH N _ D UW _ K AO R S _ DH AH _ D IY L _ W AA Z _ D AH N .
We want to play at the worlds. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ P L EY _ AE T _ DH AH _ W ER L D Z .
Sadly, it sounds as if it is. :: S AE D L IY , IH T _ S AW N D Z _ AE Z _ IH F _ IH T _ IH Z .
This is a historic occasion. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ HH IH S T AO R IH K _ AH K EY ZH AH N .
After some discussion they did. :: AE F T ER _ S AH M _ D IH S K AH SH AH N _ DH EY _ D IH D .
That means an extra two years. :: DH AE T _ M IY N Z _ AE N _ EH K S T R AH _ T UW _ Y IH R Z .
He highlighted a lack of staff. :: HH IY _ HH AY L AY T IH D _ AH _ L AE K _ AH V _ S T AE F .
That time may never be broken. :: DH AE T _ T AY M _ M EY _ N EH V ER _ B IY _ B R OW K AH N .
It was a breathtaking moment. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ B R EH TH T EY K IH NG _ M OW M AH N T .
It is too early to speculate. :: IH T _ IH Z _ T UW _ ER L IY _ T UW _ S P EH K Y AH L EY T .
We did everything by the book. :: W IY _ D IH D _ EH V R IY TH IH NG _ B AY _ DH AH _ B UH K .
This time, it might be for real. :: DH IH S _ T AY M , IH T _ M AY T _ B IY _ F AO R _ R IY L .
When we looked at the company. :: W EH N _ W IY _ L UH K T _ AE T _ DH AH _ K AH M P AH N IY .
There is a spring in the step. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ S P R IH NG _ IH N _ DH AH _ S T EH P .
I could not sit in the stands. :: AY _ K UH D _ N AA T _ S IH T _ IH N _ DH AH _ S T AE N D Z .
However, a bid was never made. :: HH AW EH V ER , AH _ B IH D _ W AA Z _ N EH V ER _ M EY D .
I enjoy the creative process. :: AY _ EH N JH OY _ DH AH _ K R IY EY T IH V _ P R AA S EH S .
Each case is treated on merit. :: IY CH _ K EY S _ IH Z _ T R IY T AH D _ AA N _ M EH R AH T .
This youngster is so exciting! :: DH IH S _ Y AH NG S T ER _ IH Z _ S OW _ IH K S AY T IH NG !
Scotland is the home of golf. :: S K AA T L AH N D _ IH Z _ DH AH _ HH OW M _ AH V _ G AA L F .
This wasn't just a big crowd. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z AH N T _ JH AH S T _ AH _ B IH G _ K R AW D .
You're not getting any goodwill. :: Y UH R _ N AA T _ G EH T IH NG _ EH N IY _ G UH D W IH L .
I am not going to judge them. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ JH AH JH _ DH EH M .
It is inherent in society. :: IH T _ IH Z _ IH N HH IH R AH N T _ IH N _ S AH S AY AH T IY .
Russell is delighted with them. :: R AH S AH L _ IH Z _ D IH L AY T AH D _ W IH DH _ DH EH M .
In Scotland, we keep the faith. :: IH N _ S K AA T L AH N D , W IY _ K IY P _ DH AH _ F EY TH .
Instead, we make the ground pay. :: IH N S T EH D , W IY _ M EY K _ DH AH _ G R AW N D _ P EY .
At the last I found a bunker. :: AE T _ DH AH _ L AE S T _ AY _ F AW N D _ AH _ B AH NG K ER .
He has run a hell of a race. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ R AH N _ AH _ HH EH L _ AH V _ AH _ R EY S .
The whole family was in shock. :: DH AH _ HH OW L _ F AE M AH L IY _ W AA Z _ IH N _ SH AA K .
Gordon is also highly rated. :: G AO R D AH N _ IH Z _ AO L S OW _ HH AY L IY _ R EY T AH D .
Today, the story is different. :: T AH D EY , DH AH _ S T AO R IY _ IH Z _ D IH F ER AH N T .
The third has yet to be named. :: DH AH _ TH ER D _ HH AE Z _ Y EH T _ T UW _ B IY _ N EY M D .
Her father wasn't best pleased. :: HH ER _ F AA DH ER _ W AA Z AH N T _ B EH S T _ P L IY Z D .
It makes a compelling display. :: IH T _ M EY K S _ AH _ K AH M P EH L IH NG _ D IH S P L EY .
But the relief was short-lived. :: B AH T _ DH AH _ R IH L IY F _ W AA Z _ SH AO R T L IH V D .
We are happy with the referee. :: W IY _ AA R _ HH AE P IY _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ R EH F ER IY .

Indeed, that has already begun. :: IH N D IY D , DH AE T _ HH AE Z _ AO L R EH D IY _ B IH G AH N .
I will build a house on the site. :: AY _ W IH L _ B IH L D _ AH _ HH AW S _ AA N _ DH AH _ S AY T .

They may not always be so lucky. :: DH EY _ M EY _ N AA T _ AO L W EY Z _ B IY _ S OW _ L AH K IY .
It was very moving, actually. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ M UW V IH NG , AE K CH AH W AH L IY .
And now he has decided, enough. :: AH N D _ N AW _ HH IY _ HH AE Z _ D IH S AY D IH D , IH N AH F .
It would be dangerous to resign. :: IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ D EY N JH ER AH S _ T UW _ R IH Z AY N .
It was then that Rangers scored. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH EH N _ DH AE T _ R EY N JH ER Z _ S K AO R D .
And that was just for starters. :: AH N D _ DH AE T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ F AO R _ S T AA R T ER Z .

And that brings us to the point. :: AH N D _ DH AE T _ B R IH NG Z _ AH S _ T UW _ DH AH _ P OY N T .
It is a matter for Westminster. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ M AE T ER _ F AO R _ W EH S T M IH N S T ER .
Like the others, he was arrested. :: L AY K _ DH AH _ AH DH ER Z , HH IY _ W AA Z _ ER EH S T AH D .
I'm just going to hit the shot. :: AY M _ JH AH S T _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ HH IH T _ DH AH _ SH AA T .
Italy was just behind the US. :: IH T AH L IY _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ B IH HH AY N D _ DH AH _ AH S .
They should take their mobile phones. :: DH EY _ SH UH D _ T EY K _ DH EH R _ M OW B AH L _ F OW N Z .

The units will not be replaced. :: DH AH _ Y UW N AH T S _ W IH L _ N AA T _ B IY _ R IY P L EY S T .

They said they were only young men. :: DH EY _ S EH D _ DH EY _ W ER _ OW N L IY _ Y AH NG _ M EH N .
We are the party of the future. :: W IY _ AA R _ DH AH _ P AA R T IY _ AH V _ DH AH _ F Y UW CH ER .
It is not affected by the sale. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH F EH K T AH D _ B AY _ DH AH _ S EY L .
Clearly, they had other problems. :: K L IH R L IY , DH EY _ HH AE D _ AH DH ER _ P R AA B L AH M Z .
Do you think we're a top nation? :: D UW _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K _ W IY R _ AH _ T AA P _ N EY SH AH N ?
His leader wanted to celebrate. :: HH IH Z _ L IY D ER _ W AA N T AH D _ T UW _ S EH L AH B R EY T .
Hopefully, this week will be good. :: HH OW P F AH L IY , DH IH S _ W IY K _ W IH L _ B IY _ G UH D .
It's as wide as a church in here. :: IH T S _ AE Z _ W AY D _ AE Z _ AH _ CH ER CH _ IH N _ HH IY R .
Then they scored two goals to win. :: DH EH N _ DH EY _ S K AO R D _ T UW _ G OW L Z _ T UW _ W IH N .
But it looks good for next year. :: B AH T _ IH T _ L UH K S _ G UH D _ F AO R _ N EH K S T _ Y IH R .

It's their duty to protect them. :: IH T S _ DH EH R _ D UW T IY _ T UW _ P R AH T EH K T _ DH EH M .
The Taliban response was swift. :: DH AH _ T AE L IH B AE N _ R IH S P AA N S _ W AA Z _ S W IH F T .

It took about five or six hours. :: IH T _ T UH K _ AH B AW T _ F AY V _ AO R _ S IH K S _ AW ER Z .
Above all, the approach is upbeat. :: AH B AH V _ AO L , DH AH _ AH P R OW CH _ IH Z _ AH P B IY T .

He replied that it was a dilemma. :: HH IY _ R IH P L AY D _ DH AE T _ IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ D IH L EH M AH .
His third child was born in April. :: HH IH Z _ TH ER D _ CH AY L D _ W AA Z _ B AO R N _ IH N _ EY P R AH L .
I would be prepared to go anywhere. :: AY _ W UH D _ B IY _ P R IY P EH R D _ T UW _ G OW _ EH N IY W EH R .
He was overwhelmed by the response. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ OW V ER W EH L M D _ B AY _ DH AH _ R IH S P AA N S .
Context is also very important. :: K AA N T EH K S T _ IH Z _ AO L S OW _ V EH R IY _ IH M P AO R T AH N T .
It was the same expression of joy. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ S EY M _ IH K S P R EH SH AH N _ AH V _ JH OY .
It was an interesting thing to do. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ IH N T R AH S T IH NG _ TH IH NG _ T UW _ D UW .
We have learned a tremendous amount. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ L ER N D _ AH _ T R AH M EH N D AH S _ AH M AW N T .
We want to replicate that success. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ R EH P L AH K EY T _ DH AE T _ S AH K S EH S .
This action could have been avoided. :: DH IH S _ AE K SH AH N _ K UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ AH V OY D AH D .
I have played well the past two days. :: AY _ HH AE V _ P L EY D _ W EH L _ DH AH _ P AE S T _ T UW _ D EY Z .
Family members are at her bedside. :: F AE M AH L IY _ M EH M B ER Z _ AA R _ AE T _ HH ER _ B EH D S AY D .
The crucial strike was yet to come. :: DH AH _ K R UW SH AH L _ S T R AY K _ W AA Z _ Y EH T _ T UW _ K AH M .
They could not have done more for me. :: DH EY _ K UH D _ N AA T _ HH AE V _ D AH N _ M AO R _ F AO R _ M IY .
I've never felt affection for Emu. :: AY V _ N EH V ER _ F EH L T _ AH F EH K SH AH N _ F AO R _ IY M Y UW .
We have great confidence in Derek. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ G R EY T _ K AA N F AH D AH N S _ IH N _ D EH R IH K .
Which is where the manager comes in. :: W IH CH _ IH Z _ W EH R _ DH AH _ M AE N AH JH ER _ K AH M Z _ IH N .
It's just not our biggest problem. :: IH T S _ JH AH S T _ N AA T _ AW ER _ B IH G AH S T _ P R AA B L AH M .
Rangers didn't turn up, by the way. :: R EY N JH ER Z _ D IH D AH N T _ T ER N _ AH P , B AY _ DH AH _ W EY .
I knew there was a challenge for me. :: AY _ N UW _ DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ CH AE L AH N JH _ F AO R _ M IY .
It has to find out what went wrong. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ F AY N D _ AW T _ W AH T _ W EH N T _ R AO NG .
We have all been there at some point. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AO L _ B IH N _ DH EH R _ AE T _ S AH M _ P OY N T .
I think it'll be a great occasion. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T AH L _ B IY _ AH _ G R EY T _ AH K EY ZH AH N .
There is too much at stake for that. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ T UW _ M AH CH _ AE T _ S T EY K _ F AO R _ DH AE T .
It has not yet opened to pupils. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ N AA T _ Y EH T _ OW P AH N D _ T UW _ P Y UW P AH L Z .
They will give it a couple of years. :: DH EY _ W IH L _ G IH V _ IH T _ AH _ K AH P AH L _ AH V _ Y IH R Z .
Our number one goal is prevention. :: AW ER _ N AH M B ER _ W AH N _ G OW L _ IH Z _ P R IY V EH N SH AH N .
It's like English in its underwear. :: IH T S _ L AY K _ IH NG G L IH SH _ IH N _ IH T S _ AH N D ER W EH R .
Everyone has his share of trouble. :: EH V R IY W AH N _ HH AE Z _ HH IH Z _ SH EH R _ AH V _ T R AH B AH L .
I did not want any damage to us. :: AY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ W AA N T _ EH N IY _ D AE M AH JH _ T UW _ AH S .
Repayment is not part of the game. :: R IY P EY M AH N T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ P AA R T _ AH V _ DH AH _ G EY M .
We just try to make great records. :: W IY _ JH AH S T _ T R AY _ T UW _ M EY K _ G R EY T _ R AH K AO R D Z .
She was shouting my baby, my baby. :: SH IY _ W AA Z _ SH AW T IH NG _ M AY _ B EY B IY , M AY _ B EY B IY .
This can only help us go forward. :: DH IH S _ K AE N _ OW N L IY _ HH EH L P _ AH S _ G OW _ F AO R W ER D .
I was happiest with my short game. :: AY _ W AA Z _ HH AE P IY AH S T _ W IH DH _ M AY _ SH AO R T _ G EY M .
It was a bit of a struggle today. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ B IH T _ AH V _ AH _ S T R AH G AH L _ T AH D EY .
Most of the public are behind me. :: M OW S T _ AH V _ DH AH _ P AH B L IH K _ AA R _ B IH HH AY N D _ M IY .
Jamming would be equally difficult. :: JH AE M IH NG _ W UH D _ B IY _ IY K W AH L IY _ D IH F AH K AH L T .
But, mainly, it is up to ourselves. :: B AH T , M EY N L IY , IH T _ IH Z _ AH P _ T UW _ AW ER S EH L V Z .
His options are severely limited. :: HH IH Z _ AA P SH AH N Z _ AA R _ S AH V IH R L IY _ L IH M AH T AH D .
He told us about it the next day. :: HH IY _ T OW L D _ AH S _ AH B AW T _ IH T _ DH AH _ N EH K S T _ D EY .
There are some new buildings in there. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ S AH M _ N UW _ B IH L D IH NG Z _ IH N _ DH EH R .
These elements are not in the book. :: DH IY Z _ EH L AH M AH N T S _ AA R _ N AA T _ IH N _ DH AH _ B UH K .
This is not great, but it goes well. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ G R EY T , B AH T _ IH T _ G OW Z _ W EH L .
How come it is so often unnoticed? :: HH AW _ K AH M _ IH T _ IH Z _ S OW _ AO F AH N _ AH N N OW T IH S T ?
It separates the men from the boys. :: IH T _ S EH P ER EY T S _ DH AH _ M EH N _ F R AH M _ DH AH _ B OY Z .
There is a tunnel after the tunnel. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AH _ T AH N AH L _ AE F T ER _ DH AH _ T AH N AH L .
The list is too long for this piece. :: DH AH _ L IH S T _ IH Z _ T UW _ L AO NG _ F AO R _ DH IH S _ P IY S .
We're all family men with children. :: W IY R _ AO L _ F AE M AH L IY _ M EH N _ W IH DH _ CH IH L D R AH N .
But there was a heavy price to pay. :: B AH T _ DH EH R _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH EH V IY _ P R AY S _ T UW _ P EY .
Just don't go looking to be shocked. :: JH AH S T _ D OW N T _ G OW _ L UH K IH NG _ T UW _ B IY _ SH AA K T .
He has changed the country itself. :: HH IY _ HH AE Z _ CH EY N JH D _ DH AH _ K AH N T R IY _ IH T S EH L F .
I've had a hard time, to be honest. :: AY V _ HH AE D _ AH _ HH AA R D _ T AY M , T UW _ B IY _ AA N AH S T .
However, it very nearly went wrong. :: HH AW EH V ER , IH T _ V EH R IY _ N IH R L IY _ W EH N T _ R AO NG .
That's what we're still trying to do. :: DH AE T S _ W AH T _ W IY R _ S T IH L _ T R AY IH NG _ T UW _ D UW .
But things are never the same again. :: B AH T _ TH IH NG Z _ AA R _ N EH V ER _ DH AH _ S EY M _ AH G EH N .
It is already making a difference. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AO L R EH D IY _ M EY K IH NG _ AH _ D IH F ER AH N S .
It doesn't seem like that long ago. :: IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ S IY M _ L AY K _ DH AE T _ L AO NG _ AH G OW .
What does he want him to look like? :: W AH T _ D AH Z _ HH IY _ W AA N T _ HH IH M _ T UW _ L UH K _ L AY K ?
I think it must be the uniforms. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T _ M AH S T _ B IY _ DH AH _ Y UW N AH F AO R M Z .
She would say he was still the best. :: SH IY _ W UH D _ S EY _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ S T IH L _ DH AH _ B EH S T .
The past is history, not destiny. :: DH AH _ P AE S T _ IH Z _ HH IH S T ER IY , N AA T _ D EH S T AH N IY .
We were very much a happy family. :: W IY _ W ER _ V EH R IY _ M AH CH _ AH _ HH AE P IY _ F AE M AH L IY .
He'd never run the distance before. :: HH IY D _ N EH V ER _ R AH N _ DH AH _ D IH S T AH N S _ B IH F AO R .
It looks as though there is no chance. :: IH T _ L UH K S _ AE Z _ DH OW _ DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ CH AE N S .
I really hope he thinks that through. :: AY _ R IH L IY _ HH OW P _ HH IY _ TH IH NG K S _ DH AE T _ TH R UW .
This is the high point of my career. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ HH AY _ P OY N T _ AH V _ M AY _ K ER IH R .
There may be hope this year, however. :: DH EH R _ M EY _ B IY _ HH OW P _ DH IH S _ Y IH R , HH AW EH V ER .
We are in a very strong position. :: W IY _ AA R _ IH N _ AH _ V EH R IY _ S T R AO NG _ P AH Z IH SH AH N .
This is not a long-term commitment. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ L AO NG T ER M _ K AH M IH T M AH N T .
The real problem is the Usher Hall. :: DH AH _ R IY L _ P R AA B L AH M _ IH Z _ DH AH _ AH SH ER _ HH AO L .
That was quite an interesting part. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ K W AY T _ AE N _ IH N T R AH S T IH NG _ P AA R T .
The jury is still out on this one. :: DH AH _ JH UH R IY _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ AW T _ AA N _ DH IH S _ W AH N .
This is important for two reasons. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ IH M P AO R T AH N T _ F AO R _ T UW _ R IY Z AH N Z .
It was just an accident of birth. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ AE N _ AE K S AH D AH N T _ AH V _ B ER TH .
The auction has seven days to run. :: DH AH _ AA K SH AH N _ HH AE Z _ S EH V AH N _ D EY Z _ T UW _ R AH N .
Hopefully it will be tomorrow night. :: HH OW P F AH L IY _ IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ T AH M AA R OW _ N AY T .
I think we could do well in Europe. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ W IY _ K UH D _ D UW _ W EH L _ IH N _ Y UH R AH P .
We are going to listen to Britain. :: W IY _ AA R _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ L IH S AH N _ T UW _ B R IH T AH N .
We'll have to be satisfied with it. :: W IY L _ HH AE V _ T UW _ B IY _ S AE T AH S F AY D _ W IH DH _ IH T .
He said, we're delighted by the vote. :: HH IY _ S EH D , W IY R _ D IH L AY T AH D _ B AY _ DH AH _ V OW T .
One is investment, one is reform. :: W AH N _ IH Z _ IH N V EH S T M AH N T , W AH N _ IH Z _ R AH F AO R M .
There was nothing sinister in that. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ S IH N IH S T ER _ IH N _ DH AE T .
We are aware of the two incidents. :: W IY _ AA R _ AH W EH R _ AH V _ DH AH _ T UW _ IH N S AH D AH N T S .
I had troubles with the producers. :: AY _ HH AE D _ T R AH B AH L Z _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ P R AH D UW S ER Z .
He is the saviour of South Africa. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S EY V Y ER _ AH V _ S AW TH _ AE F R AH K AH .
Actually, nothing much will change. :: AE K CH AH W AH L IY , N AH TH IH NG _ M AH CH _ W IH L _ CH EY N JH .
It will be all about the Olympics. :: IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ AO L _ AH B AW T _ DH AH _ OW L IH M P IH K S .
I have not seen the term immediate. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ S IY N _ DH AH _ T ER M _ IH M IY D IY AH T .
The bombing begins in five minutes. :: DH AH _ B AA M IH NG _ B IH G IH N Z _ IH N _ F AY V _ M IH N AH T S .
No, we were not exactly favourites. :: N OW , W IY _ W ER _ N AA T _ IH G Z AE K T L IY _ F EY V ER IH T S .
I want to celebrate the World Cup. :: AY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ S EH L AH B R EY T _ DH AH _ W ER L D _ K AH P .
They could have been told in advance. :: DH EY _ K UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ T OW L D _ IH N _ AH D V AE N S .
Everything is coming together well. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ IH Z _ K AH M IH NG _ T AH G EH DH ER _ W EH L .
It doesn't make me feel any better. :: IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ M EY K _ M IY _ F IY L _ EH N IY _ B EH T ER .
It's a good offer by any standards. :: IH T S _ AH _ G UH D _ AO F ER _ B AY _ EH N IY _ S T AE N D ER D Z .
A decision is expected tomorrow. :: AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ IH Z _ IH K S P EH K T AH D _ T AH M AA R OW .
I'm not allowed to speak to anyone. :: AY M _ N AA T _ AH L AW D _ T UW _ S P IY K _ T UW _ EH N IY W AH N .
Success in Scotland is important. :: S AH K S EH S _ IH N _ S K AA T L AH N D _ IH Z _ IH M P AO R T AH N T .
We want him to continue that way. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ HH IH M _ T UW _ K AH N T IH N Y UW _ DH AE T _ W EY .
This isn't some form of commission. :: DH IH S _ IH Z AH N T _ S AH M _ F AO R M _ AH V _ K AH M IH SH AH N .
They made such decisions in London. :: DH EY _ M EY D _ S AH CH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N Z _ IH N _ L AH N D AH N .
If that's the case, he will struggle. :: IH F _ DH AE T S _ DH AH _ K EY S , HH IY _ W IH L _ S T R AH G AH L .
We could easily have lost that game. :: W IY _ K UH D _ IY Z AH L IY _ HH AE V _ L AO S T _ DH AE T _ G EY M .
The strong pound also took its toll. :: DH AH _ S T R AO NG _ P AW N D _ AO L S OW _ T UH K _ IH T S _ T OW L .
He took me on a tour of the wards. :: HH IY _ T UH K _ M IY _ AA N _ AH _ T UH R _ AH V _ DH AH _ W AO R D Z .
Offered the gold medal, he declined. :: AO F ER D _ DH AH _ G OW L D _ M EH D AH L , HH IY _ D IH K L AY N D .
The girls are so lucky to be alive. :: DH AH _ G ER L Z _ AA R _ S OW _ L AH K IY _ T UW _ B IY _ AH L AY V .
We've got a good management record. :: W IY V _ G AA T _ AH _ G UH D _ M AE N AH JH M AH N T _ R AH K AO R D .
Part of the complex is historic. :: P AA R T _ AH V _ DH AH _ K AA M P L EH K S _ IH Z _ HH IH S T AO R IH K .
This trend is likely to strengthen. :: DH IH S _ T R EH N D _ IH Z _ L AY K L IY _ T UW _ S T R EH NG TH AH N .
Also, it is the season of goodwill. :: AO L S OW , IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ S IY Z AH N _ AH V _ G UH D W IH L .
We will deliver at director level. :: W IY _ W IH L _ D IH L IH V ER _ AE T _ D ER EH K T ER _ L EH V AH L .
The following day I used the story. :: DH AH _ F AA L OW IH NG _ D EY _ AY _ Y UW Z D _ DH AH _ S T AO R IY .
This is a frightening development. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ F R AY T AH N IH NG _ D IH V EH L AH P M AH N T .
But there's an upturn in the sector. :: B AH T _ DH EH R Z _ AE N _ AH P T ER N _ IH N _ DH AH _ S EH K T ER .
Here the picture is broadly stable. :: HH IY R _ DH AH _ P IH K CH ER _ IH Z _ B R AO D L IY _ S T EY B AH L .
I believe we can handle this okay. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ W IY _ K AE N _ HH AE N D AH L _ DH IH S _ OW K EY .
Instead, another depression came in. :: IH N S T EH D , AH N AH DH ER _ D IH P R EH SH AH N _ K EY M _ IH N .
We have reacted well to each other. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ R IY AE K T AH D _ W EH L _ T UW _ IY CH _ AH DH ER .
Further details are expected later. :: F ER DH ER _ D IH T EY L Z _ AA R _ IH K S P EH K T AH D _ L EY T ER .
If you believe in the blue and white. :: IH F _ Y UW _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ DH AH _ B L UW _ AH N D _ W AY T .
I was fighting for my life, I thought. :: AY _ W AA Z _ F AY T IH NG _ F AO R _ M AY _ L AY F , AY _ TH AO T .
It was finally agreed on Saturday. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ F AY N AH L IY _ AH G R IY D _ AA N _ S AE T ER D IY .
He had no access to the database. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ AE K S EH S _ T UW _ DH AH _ D EY T AH B EY S .
That was a disgraceful performance. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH _ D IH S G R EY S F AH L _ P ER F AO R M AH N S .
Growth will come later in the cycle. :: G R OW TH _ W IH L _ K AH M _ L EY T ER _ IH N _ DH AH _ S AY K AH L .
We know about the crisis in cattle. :: W IY _ N OW _ AH B AW T _ DH AH _ K R AY S AH S _ IH N _ K AE T AH L .
There is no doubt there's room for us. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ D AW T _ DH EH R Z _ R UW M _ F AO R _ AH S .
I've got to provide for my family. :: AY V _ G AA T _ T UW _ P R AH V AY D _ F AO R _ M AY _ F AE M AH L IY .
In the end we made too many errors. :: IH N _ DH AH _ EH N D _ W IY _ M EY D _ T UW _ M EH N IY _ EH R ER Z .
We have to put pressure on Rangers. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ P UH T _ P R EH SH ER _ AA N _ R EY N JH ER Z .
I can't wait for the season to end. :: AY _ K AE N T _ W EY T _ F AO R _ DH AH _ S IY Z AH N _ T UW _ EH N D .
I feel confident about the outcome. :: AY _ F IY L _ K AA N F AH D AH N T _ AH B AW T _ DH AH _ AW T K AH M .
This is a big game for both of us. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ B IH G _ G EY M _ F AO R _ B OW TH _ AH V _ AH S .
It looks at public interest issues. :: IH T _ L UH K S _ AE T _ P AH B L IH K _ IH N T R AH S T _ IH SH UW Z .
He enjoyed being with his family. :: HH IY _ EH N JH OY D _ B IY IH NG _ W IH DH _ HH IH Z _ F AE M AH L IY .
There was no basis for their arrest. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ B EY S AH S _ F AO R _ DH EH R _ ER EH S T .
A young Briton had a lucky escape. :: AH _ Y AH NG _ B R IH T AH N _ HH AE D _ AH _ L AH K IY _ IH S K EY P .
Playing in Europe is the benchmark. :: P L EY IH NG _ IH N _ Y UH R AH P _ IH Z _ DH AH _ B EH N CH M AA R K .
Last season was very hard for me. :: L AE S T _ S IY Z AH N _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ HH AA R D _ F AO R _ M IY .
I have always loved the countryside. :: AY _ HH AE V _ AO L W EY Z _ L AH V D _ DH AH _ K AH N T R IY S AY D .
It's not going to work out that way. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ W ER K _ AW T _ DH AE T _ W EY .
IT is called a killing in the trade. :: IH T _ IH Z _ K AO L D _ AH _ K IH L IH NG _ IH N _ DH AH _ T R EY D .
It really was an unusual award. :: IH T _ R IH L IY _ W AA Z _ AE N _ AH N Y UW ZH AH W AH L _ AH W AO R D .
We have a long way to go this week. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH _ L AO NG _ W EY _ T UW _ G OW _ DH IH S _ W IY K .
I am constantly changing my mind. :: AY _ AE M _ K AA N S T AH N T L IY _ CH EY N JH IH NG _ M AY _ M AY N D .
He is the example for all of us. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ DH AH _ IH G Z AE M P AH L _ F AO R _ AO L _ AH V _ AH S .
I'm surprised to hear it from Tony. :: AY M _ S ER P R AY Z D _ T UW _ HH IY R _ IH T _ F R AH M _ T OW N IY .
I seem to keep this for the majors. :: AY _ S IY M _ T UW _ K IY P _ DH IH S _ F AO R _ DH AH _ M EY JH ER Z .
This is excellent news for Glasgow. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ EH K S AH L AH N T _ N UW Z _ F AO R _ G L AE S K OW .
That was my own personal decision. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ M AY _ OW N _ P ER S IH N IH L _ D IH S IH ZH AH N .
They were the better team on the night. :: DH EY _ W ER _ DH AH _ B EH T ER _ T IY M _ AA N _ DH AH _ N AY T .
A neighbour said the street was shocked. :: AH _ N EY B ER _ S EH D _ DH AH _ S T R IY T _ W AA Z _ SH AA K T .
They tend to be female and retired. :: DH EY _ T EH N D _ T UW _ B IY _ F IY M EY L _ AH N D _ R IH T AY R D .
There is no shortage of commitment. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ SH AO R T AH JH _ AH V _ K AH M IH T M AH N T .
We're talking about one or two years. :: W IY R _ T AO K IH NG _ AH B AW T _ W AH N _ AO R _ T UW _ Y IH R Z .
There are no excuses left for us. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ N OW _ IH K S K Y UW S IH Z _ L EH F T _ F AO R _ AH S .
From there, it was a success story. :: F R AH M _ DH EH R , IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ S AH K S EH S _ S T AO R IY .
It has been supremely successful. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ S UW P R IY M AH L IY _ S AH K S EH S F AH L .
He declined to give further details. :: HH IY _ D IH K L AY N D _ T UW _ G IH V _ F ER DH ER _ D IH T EY L Z .
That's a lot of bodies to tolerate. :: DH AE T S _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ B AA D IY Z _ T UW _ T AA L ER EY T .
I can't see myself in one of those. :: AY _ K AE N T _ S IY _ M AY S EH L F _ IH N _ W AH N _ AH V _ DH OW Z .
We are right at the heart of Europe. :: W IY _ AA R _ R AY T _ AE T _ DH AH _ HH AA R T _ AH V _ Y UH R AH P .
What kind of festival is proposed? :: W AH T _ K AY N D _ AH V _ F EH S T AH V AH L _ IH Z _ P R AH P OW Z D ?
This year it will be Billy Crystal. :: DH IH S _ Y IH R _ IH T _ W IH L _ B IY _ B IH L IY _ K R IH S T AH L .
That is not a position they enjoy. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ P AH Z IH SH AH N _ DH EY _ EH N JH OY .
This ruling is unfair to everyone. :: DH IH S _ R UW L IH NG _ IH Z _ AH N F EH R _ T UW _ EH V R IY W AH N .
I'm sure you all can relate to that. :: AY M _ SH UH R _ Y UW _ AO L _ K AE N _ R IH L EY T _ T UW _ DH AE T .
I can understand why they have gone. :: AY _ K AE N _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ W AY _ DH EY _ HH AE V _ G AO N .
I'm delighted at Murray's appointment. :: AY M _ D IH L AY T AH D _ AE T _ M ER IY Z _ AH P OY N T M AH N T .
He had lost his confidence again. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ L AO S T _ HH IH Z _ K AA N F AH D AH N S _ AH G EH N .
It was to be published next month. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ T UW _ B IY _ P AH B L IH SH T _ N EH K S T _ M AH N TH .
It is par for the course, isn't it? :: IH T _ IH Z _ P AA R _ F AO R _ DH AH _ K AO R S , IH Z AH N T _ IH T ?
Who would take it now, after all this? :: HH UW _ W UH D _ T EY K _ IH T _ N AW , AE F T ER _ AO L _ DH IH S ?
Would he be able to live with that? :: W UH D _ HH IY _ B IY _ EY B AH L _ T UW _ L AY V _ W IH DH _ DH AE T ?
Top-up fees are not on the agenda. :: T AA P AH P _ F IY Z _ AA R _ N AA T _ AA N _ DH AH _ AH JH EH N D AH .
We certainly will need to watch him. :: W IY _ S ER T AH N L IY _ W IH L _ N IY D _ T UW _ W AA CH _ HH IH M .
Our offer will remain on the table. :: AW ER _ AO F ER _ W IH L _ R IH M EY N _ AA N _ DH AH _ T EY B AH L .
We are trying to establish a date. :: W IY _ AA R _ T R AY IH NG _ T UW _ IH S T AE B L IH SH _ AH _ D EY T .
We should be trying to keep him in. :: W IY _ SH UH D _ B IY _ T R AY IH NG _ T UW _ K IY P _ HH IH M _ IH N .
The things writers and directors say! :: DH AH _ TH IH NG Z _ R AY T ER Z _ AH N D _ D ER EH K T ER Z _ S EY !
There is nothing like a fresh start. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ L AY K _ AH _ F R EH SH _ S T AA R T .
That was a stunning drive from Jon. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ AH _ S T AH N IH NG _ D R AY V _ F R AH M _ JH AA N .
There is nothing like this back home. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ L AY K _ DH IH S _ B AE K _ HH OW M .
I just saw them for a few minutes. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ S AO _ DH EH M _ F AO R _ AH _ F Y UW _ M IH N AH T S .
The threat to rural areas is real. :: DH AH _ TH R EH T _ T UW _ R UH R AH L _ EH R IY AH Z _ IH Z _ R IY L .
That's the kind of thing that counts. :: DH AE T S _ DH AH _ K AY N D _ AH V _ TH IH NG _ DH AE T _ K AW N T S .
The team this year is going places. :: DH AH _ T IY M _ DH IH S _ Y IH R _ IH Z _ G OW IH NG _ P L EY S AH Z .

I don't believe in gesture politics. :: AY _ D OW N T _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ JH EH S CH ER _ P AA L AH T IH K S .
I haven't been able to do it since. :: AY _ HH AE V AH N T _ B IH N _ EY B AH L _ T UW _ D UW _ IH T _ S IH N S .
That never came to court as a charge. :: DH AE T _ N EH V ER _ K EY M _ T UW _ K AO R T _ AE Z _ AH _ CH AA R JH .
Players want to know what is on offer. :: P L EY ER Z _ W AA N T _ T UW _ N OW _ W AH T _ IH Z _ AA N _ AO F ER .
I just wanted to get off the course. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ W AA N T AH D _ T UW _ G EH T _ AO F _ DH AH _ K AO R S .
The old manager, he didn't like me. :: DH AH _ OW L D _ M AE N AH JH ER , HH IY _ D IH D AH N T _ L AY K _ M IY .
But he seemed to enjoy the challenge. :: B AH T _ HH IY _ S IY M D _ T UW _ EH N JH OY _ DH AH _ CH AE L AH N JH .
We know the fight is going to happen. :: W IY _ N OW _ DH AH _ F AY T _ IH Z _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ HH AE P AH N .
This means a lot of hard decisions. :: DH IH S _ M IY N Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ HH AA R D _ D IH S IH ZH AH N Z .
From the opening Could It Be Magic? :: F R AH M _ DH AH _ OW P AH N IH NG _ K UH D _ IH T _ B IY _ M AE JH IH K ?
Let us hope it doesn't come to that. :: L EH T _ AH S _ HH OW P _ IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ K AH M _ T UW _ DH AE T .
Prime minister Blair is not that way. :: P R AY M _ M IH N AH S T ER _ B L EH R _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AE T _ W EY .
I believe in having difficult times. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ HH AE V IH NG _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ T AY M Z .
It was the only possible decision. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ OW N L IY _ P AA S AH B AH L _ D IH S IH ZH AH N .
I just don't know what she was doing. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ D OW N T _ N OW _ W AH T _ SH IY _ W AA Z _ D UW IH NG .
Drugs are used a lot at the fishing. :: D R AH G Z _ AA R _ Y UW Z D _ AH _ L AA T _ AE T _ DH AH _ F IH SH IH NG .
They have the cash and the fire power. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ DH AH _ K AE SH _ AH N D _ DH AH _ F AY ER _ P AW ER .
THE pain was almost too much to bear. :: DH AH _ P EY N _ W AA Z _ AO L M OW S T _ T UW _ M AH CH _ T UW _ B EH R .
It is a good day for the coalition. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ G UH D _ D EY _ F AO R _ DH AH _ K OW AH L IH SH AH N .
This plan is an agenda for action. :: DH IH S _ P L AE N _ IH Z _ AE N _ AH JH EH N D AH _ F AO R _ AE K SH AH N .
The problems began a long time ago. :: DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M Z _ B IH G AE N _ AH _ L AO NG _ T AY M _ AH G OW .
I expected these kind of questions. :: AY _ IH K S P EH K T AH D _ DH IY Z _ K AY N D _ AH V _ K W EH S CH AH N Z .
If not, a deal could take many months. :: IH F _ N AA T , AH _ D IY L _ K UH D _ T EY K _ M EH N IY _ M AH N TH S .
There's nothing we could do about this. :: DH EH R Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ W IY _ K UH D _ D UW _ AH B AW T _ DH IH S .
The road was closed for several hours. :: DH AH _ R OW D _ W AA Z _ K L OW Z D _ F AO R _ S EH V R AH L _ AW ER Z .
I never thought it would take this long. :: AY _ N EH V ER _ TH AO T _ IH T _ W UH D _ T EY K _ DH IH S _ L AO NG .
I cannot wait to get started on it. :: AY _ K AE N AA T _ W EY T _ T UW _ G EH T _ S T AA R T AH D _ AA N _ IH T .
However, the devil is in the detail. :: HH AW EH V ER , DH AH _ D EH V AH L _ IH Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ D IH T EY L .
We are not interested in dividends. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ IH N T R AH S T AH D _ IH N _ D IH V AH D EH N D Z .
Motorists will buy passes in advance. :: M OW T ER AH S T S _ W IH L _ B AY _ P AE S AH Z _ IH N _ AH D V AE N S .
The early physical reports were clear. :: DH AH _ ER L IY _ F IH Z IH K AH L _ R IH P AO R T S _ W ER _ K L IH R .
That decision has already been made. :: DH AE T _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ HH AE Z _ AO L R EH D IY _ B IH N _ M EY D .
They were not even allowed to see them. :: DH EY _ W ER _ N AA T _ IY V IH N _ AH L AW D _ T UW _ S IY _ DH EH M .
They had to be cut from the wreckage. :: DH EY _ HH AE D _ T UW _ B IY _ K AH T _ F R AH M _ DH AH _ R EH K AH JH .
I was in the train station overnight. :: AY _ W AA Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ T R EY N _ S T EY SH AH N _ OW V ER N AY T .
They might have asked, for goodness sake. :: DH EY _ M AY T _ HH AE V _ AE S K T , F AO R _ G UH D N AH S _ S EY K .
The protest will go ahead as planned. :: DH AH _ P R OW T EH S T _ W IH L _ G OW _ AH HH EH D _ AE Z _ P L AE N D .
I just felt that I was broken down. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ F EH L T _ DH AE T _ AY _ W AA Z _ B R OW K AH N _ D AW N .
It is the right package for Scotland. :: IH T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ R AY T _ P AE K AH JH _ F AO R _ S K AA T L AH N D .
I think there's not much between them. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ DH EH R Z _ N AA T _ M AH CH _ B IH T W IY N _ DH EH M .
Both players gave so much to the side. :: B OW TH _ P L EY ER Z _ G EY V _ S OW _ M AH CH _ T UW _ DH AH _ S AY D .
This is not a small amount of money. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ S M AO L _ AH M AW N T _ AH V _ M AH N IY .
We are keen to see truth and justice. :: W IY _ AA R _ K IY N _ T UW _ S IY _ T R UW TH _ AH N D _ JH AH S T AH S .
Hopefully, he will get a lucky break. :: HH OW P F AH L IY , HH IY _ W IH L _ G EH T _ AH _ L AH K IY _ B R EY K .
I could have got out a long time ago. :: AY _ K UH D _ HH AE V _ G AA T _ AW T _ AH _ L AO NG _ T AY M _ AH G OW .
The website has changed the company. :: DH AH _ W EH B S AY T _ HH AE Z _ CH EY N JH D _ DH AH _ K AH M P AH N IY .
The Royal Highland was no exception. :: DH AH _ R OY AH L _ HH AY L AH N D _ W AA Z _ N OW _ IH K S EH P SH AH N .
That is the only way to rate players. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ DH AH _ OW N L IY _ W EY _ T UW _ R EY T _ P L EY ER Z .
He also has a Scottish grandfather. :: HH IY _ AO L S OW _ HH AE Z _ AH _ S K AA T IH SH _ G R AE N D F AA DH ER .
It could be to do with the location. :: IH T _ K UH D _ B IY _ T UW _ D UW _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ L OW K EY SH AH N .
The pain was almost too much to bear. :: DH AH _ P EY N _ W AA Z _ AO L M OW S T _ T UW _ M AH CH _ T UW _ B EH R .
Confidence is as low as it can get. :: K AA N F AH D AH N S _ IH Z _ AE Z _ L OW _ AE Z _ IH T _ K AE N _ G EH T .
It's for that reason he should resign. :: IH T S _ F AO R _ DH AE T _ R IY Z AH N _ HH IY _ SH UH D _ R IH Z AY N .
There were no plans for a rights issue. :: DH EH R _ W ER _ N OW _ P L AE N Z _ F AO R _ AH _ R AY T S _ IH SH UW .
He also had a Scottish grandfather. :: HH IY _ AO L S OW _ HH AE D _ AH _ S K AA T IH SH _ G R AE N D F AA DH ER .
We are not doing the Today programme. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ D UW IH NG _ DH AH _ T AH D EY _ P R OW G R AE M .
We make this offer to the parliament. :: W IY _ M EY K _ DH IH S _ AO F ER _ T UW _ DH AH _ P AA R L AH M AH N T .
It doesn't come any better than this. :: IH T _ D AH Z AH N T _ K AH M _ EH N IY _ B EH T ER _ DH AE N _ DH IH S .
Let's see that increase over the years. :: L EH T S _ S IY _ DH AE T _ IH N K R IY S _ OW V ER _ DH AH _ Y IH R Z .
Then there's the problem of sympathy. :: DH EH N _ DH EH R Z _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M _ AH V _ S IH M P AH TH IY .
That's why he is a national treasure. :: DH AE T S _ W AY _ HH IY _ IH Z _ AH _ N AE SH AH N AH L _ T R EH ZH ER .
Why did it take a concerted campaign? :: W AY _ D IH D _ IH T _ T EY K _ AH _ K AH N S ER T AH D _ K AE M P EY N ?
Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice. :: M IH S IH Z _ T EY L ER _ IH Z _ T EY K IH NG _ L IY G AH L _ AE D V AY S .
They were not doing it too well, either. :: DH EY _ W ER _ N AA T _ D UW IH NG _ IH T _ T UW _ W EH L , IY DH ER .
We have very real concerns about it. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ V EH R IY _ R IY L _ K AH N S ER N Z _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
There was no change in the strategy. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ CH EY N JH _ IH N _ DH AH _ S T R AE T AH JH IY .
We have a genuine budget in place. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH _ JH EH N Y AH W AH N _ B AH JH IH T _ IH N _ P L EY S .
He had asked if they had the script. :: HH IY _ HH AE D _ AE S K T _ IH F _ DH EY _ HH AE D _ DH AH _ S K R IH P T .
If you're going to do it, do it right. :: IH F _ Y UH R _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ D UW _ IH T , D UW _ IH T _ R AY T .
We would have looked out for each other. :: W IY _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ L UH K T _ AW T _ F AO R _ IY CH _ AH DH ER .
There's nothing new in that argument. :: DH EH R Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ N UW _ IH N _ DH AE T _ AA R G Y AH M AH N T .
I am very sorry to hear about this. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ S AA R IY _ T UW _ HH IY R _ AH B AW T _ DH IH S .
He intends to appeal the sentences. :: HH IY _ IH N T EH N D Z _ T UW _ AH P IY L _ DH AH _ S EH N T AH N S AH Z .
His primary residence is Scotland. :: HH IH Z _ P R AY M EH R IY _ R EH Z IH D AH N S _ IH Z _ S K AA T L AH N D .
It could have been a hammering by now. :: IH T _ K UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ AH _ HH AE M ER IH NG _ B AY _ N AW .
Most of them were one-year conscripts. :: M OW S T _ AH V _ DH EH M _ W ER _ W AH N Y IH R _ K AA N S K R IH P T S .
They seem to be backing off from that. :: DH EY _ S IY M _ T UW _ B IY _ B AE K IH NG _ AO F _ F R AH M _ DH AE T .
It is a difficult thing to explain. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ TH IH NG _ T UW _ IH K S P L EY N .
I get to work with very good people. :: AY _ G EH T _ T UW _ W ER K _ W IH DH _ V EH R IY _ G UH D _ P IY P AH L .
I hope my successor will do the same. :: AY _ HH OW P _ M AY _ S AH K S EH S ER _ W IH L _ D UW _ DH AH _ S EY M .
We need to be looking to the future. :: W IY _ N IY D _ T UW _ B IY _ L UH K IH NG _ T UW _ DH AH _ F Y UW CH ER .
Once they go away they won't come back. :: W AH N S _ DH EY _ G OW _ AH W EY _ DH EY _ W OW N T _ K AH M _ B AE K .
I don't know what he was capable of. :: AY _ D OW N T _ N OW _ W AH T _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ K EY P AH B AH L _ AH V .
The encounter was to change his life. :: DH AH _ IH N K AW N T ER _ W AA Z _ T UW _ CH EY N JH _ HH IH Z _ L AY F .
We don't just play golf in Scotland. :: W IY _ D OW N T _ JH AH S T _ P L EY _ G AA L F _ IH N _ S K AA T L AH N D .
Do not go into government buildings. :: D UW _ N AA T _ G OW _ IH N T UW _ G AH V ER M AH N T _ B IH L D IH NG Z .
Do you think they would be any better? :: D UW _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K _ DH EY _ W UH D _ B IY _ EH N IY _ B EH T ER ?
This is a one-year deal, but who knows? :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ W AH N Y IH R _ D IY L , B AH T _ HH UW _ N OW Z ?
The outstanding issues are still there. :: DH AH _ AW T S T AE N D IH NG _ IH SH UW Z _ AA R _ S T IH L _ DH EH R .
We have taken steps to rectify it. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T EY K AH N _ S T EH P S _ T UW _ R EH K T AH F AY _ IH T .
We have a strong team at the moment. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AH _ S T R AO NG _ T IY M _ AE T _ DH AH _ M OW M AH N T .
It is not about changing our image. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH B AW T _ CH EY N JH IH NG _ AW ER _ IH M AH JH .
There is no pressure from anyone now. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ P R EH SH ER _ F R AH M _ EH N IY W AH N _ N AW .
This is not a recipe for conflict. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ R EH S AH P IY _ F AO R _ K AA N F L IH K T .
He was lying face down in the water. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ L AY IH NG _ F EY S _ D AW N _ IH N _ DH AH _ W AO T ER .
They too refused to come out and talk. :: DH EY _ T UW _ R AH F Y UW Z D _ T UW _ K AH M _ AW T _ AH N D _ T AO K .
It's the stop-gap before extinction. :: IH T S _ DH AH _ S T AA P G AE P _ B IH F AO R _ IH K S T IH NG K SH AH N .
Do you think they would do any better? :: D UW _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K _ DH EY _ W UH D _ D UW _ EH N IY _ B EH T ER ?
This, too, could prove a risky business. :: DH IH S , T UW , K UH D _ P R UW V _ AH _ R IH S K IY _ B IH Z N AH S .
The Master was by then just too old. :: DH AH _ M AE S T ER _ W AA Z _ B AY _ DH EH N _ JH AH S T _ T UW _ OW L D .
In fact, they will not be disciplined. :: IH N _ F AE K T , DH EY _ W IH L _ N AA T _ B IY _ D IH S AH P L AH N D .
I'd never heard him in person before. :: AY D _ N EH V ER _ HH ER D _ HH IH M _ IH N _ P ER S AH N _ B IH F AO R .
That is not the way we should operate. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ W EY _ W IY _ SH UH D _ AA P ER EY T .
It is a decision which has paid off. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ W IH CH _ HH AE Z _ P EY D _ AO F .
He decides to do something about it. :: HH IY _ D IH S AY D Z _ T UW _ D UW _ S AH M TH IH NG _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
There will be no change in government. :: DH EH R _ W IH L _ B IY _ N OW _ CH EY N JH _ IH N _ G AH V ER M AH N T .
Sadly, in this case, that was not so. :: S AE D L IY , IH N _ DH IH S _ K EY S , DH AE T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ S OW .
The Rangers think they have problems. :: DH AH _ R EY N JH ER Z _ TH IH NG K _ DH EY _ HH AE V _ P R AA B L AH M Z .
I think it can count against you now. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ IH T _ K AE N _ K AW N T _ AH G EH N S T _ Y UW _ N AW .
They are still going to be impulsive. :: DH EY _ AA R _ S T IH L _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ B IY _ IH M P AH L S IH V .
We must not give in to the bastards. :: W IY _ M AH S T _ N AA T _ G IH V _ IH N _ T UW _ DH AH _ B AE S T ER D Z .
That was the biggest game of my life. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ B IH G AH S T _ G EY M _ AH V _ M AY _ L AY F .
That is impressive by any standards. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ IH M P R EH S IH V _ B AY _ EH N IY _ S T AE N D ER D Z .
That, though, was just the start of it. :: DH AE T , DH OW , W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ DH AH _ S T AA R T _ AH V _ IH T .
Before the games it was pretty open. :: B IH F AO R _ DH AH _ G EY M Z _ IH T _ W AA Z _ P R IH T IY _ OW P AH N .
You've obviously got an answer to it. :: Y UW V _ AA B V IY AH S L IY _ G AA T _ AE N _ AE N S ER _ T UW _ IH T .
There is access for disabled people. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ AE K S EH S _ F AO R _ D IH S EY B AH L D _ P IY P AH L .
Some reports said they had been killed. :: S AH M _ R IH P AO R T S _ S EH D _ DH EY _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ K IH L D .
There was no need for such a hostel. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N OW _ N IY D _ F AO R _ S AH CH _ AH _ HH AA S T AH L .
And our game is about going forward. :: AH N D _ AW ER _ G EY M _ IH Z _ AH B AW T _ G OW IH NG _ F AO R W ER D .
This will be great for the young lads. :: DH IH S _ W IH L _ B IY _ G R EY T _ F AO R _ DH AH _ Y AH NG _ L AE D Z .
The question is, Is that a negative? :: DH AH _ K W EH S CH AH N _ IH Z , IH Z _ DH AE T _ AH _ N EH G AH T IH V ?
The committee's remit is far reaching. :: DH AH _ K AH M IH T IY Z _ R IY M IH T _ IH Z _ F AA R _ R IY CH IH NG .
Altman has every right to be bitter. :: AO L T M AH N _ HH AE Z _ EH V ER IY _ R AY T _ T UW _ B IY _ B IH T ER .
They've not let anyone into the loop. :: DH EY V _ N AA T _ L EH T _ EH N IY W AH N _ IH N T UW _ DH AH _ L UW P .
His attacker has been a Rangers fan. :: HH IH Z _ AH T AE K ER _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ AH _ R EY N JH ER Z _ F AE N .
I'm delighted to be coming back home. :: AY M _ D IH L AY T AH D _ T UW _ B IY _ K AH M IH NG _ B AE K _ HH OW M .
I reported it but nothing was done. :: AY _ R IY P AO R T AH D _ IH T _ B AH T _ N AH TH IH NG _ W AA Z _ D AH N .
Do they have to create seven majors? :: D UW _ DH EY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ K R IY EY T _ S EH V AH N _ M EY JH ER Z ?
It is, though the law is not clear cut. :: IH T _ IH Z , DH OW _ DH AH _ L AO _ IH Z _ N AA T _ K L IH R _ K AH T .
They were willing us to get a second. :: DH EY _ W ER _ W IH L IH NG _ AH S _ T UW _ G EH T _ AH _ S EH K AH N D .
It is understood he had been stabbed. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH N D ER S T UH D _ HH IY _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ S T AE B D .
We are not the first to be affected. :: W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ DH AH _ F ER S T _ T UW _ B IY _ AH F EH K T AH D .
He's had a lot of injury problems. :: HH IY Z _ HH AE D _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ IH N JH ER IY _ P R AA B L AH M Z .
I believe she was elected unopposed. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ SH IY _ W AA Z _ IH L EH K T AH D _ AH N AH P OW Z D .
That perhaps is behind the problem. :: DH AE T _ P ER HH AE P S _ IH Z _ B IH HH AY N D _ DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
Usually the enjoyment is two ways. :: Y UW ZH AH W AH L IY _ DH AH _ EH N JH OY M AH N T _ IH Z _ T UW _ W EY Z .
Firstly, we don't know we can do this. :: F ER S T L IY , W IY _ D OW N T _ N OW _ W IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ DH IH S .
I have never seen anything like this. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N EH V ER _ S IY N _ EH N IY TH IH NG _ L AY K _ DH IH S .
It is something that we would support. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S AH M TH IH NG _ DH AE T _ W IY _ W UH D _ S AH P AO R T .
I have been struggling with my form. :: AY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ S T R AH G AH L IH NG _ W IH DH _ M AY _ F AO R M .
That clearly wasn't what they wanted. :: DH AE T _ K L IH R L IY _ W AA Z AH N T _ W AH T _ DH EY _ W AA N T AH D .
It's very difficult to find a buyer. :: IH T S _ V EH R IY _ D IH F AH K AH L T _ T UW _ F AY N D _ AH _ B AY ER .
The results are sometimes contentious. :: DH AH _ R IH Z AH L T S _ AA R _ S AH M T AY M Z _ K AH N T EH N SH AH S .
It is much as it has been described. :: IH T _ IH Z _ M AH CH _ AE Z _ IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ D IH S K R AY B D .
I was the last man to touch the ball. :: AY _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ L AE S T _ M AE N _ T UW _ T AH CH _ DH AH _ B AO L .
I wanted to put myself on the line. :: AY _ W AA N T AH D _ T UW _ P UH T _ M AY S EH L F _ AA N _ DH AH _ L AY N .
It is not like working for a living. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ L AY K _ W ER K IH NG _ F AO R _ AH _ L IH V IH NG .
He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter. :: HH IY _ L IY V Z _ AH _ W AY F , AH _ S AH N _ AH N D _ AH _ D AO T ER .

The party has never fully recovered. :: DH AH _ P AA R T IY _ HH AE Z _ N EH V ER _ F UH L IY _ R AH K AH V ER D .
His concern is only for the future. :: HH IH Z _ K AH N S ER N _ IH Z _ OW N L IY _ F AO R _ DH AH _ F Y UW CH ER .
He was just like a godfather to it. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ JH AH S T _ L AY K _ AH _ G AA D F AA DH ER _ T UW _ IH T .
It was started almost by accident. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ S T AA R T AH D _ AO L M OW S T _ B AY _ AE K S AH D AH N T .
Their conclusions were never published. :: DH EH R _ K AH N K L UW ZH AH N Z _ W ER _ N EH V ER _ P AH B L IH SH T .

The idea is the shop within a shop. :: DH AH _ AY D IY AH _ IH Z _ DH AH _ SH AA P _ W IH DH IH N _ AH _ SH AA P .
The fans pay for their season tickets. :: DH AH _ F AE N Z _ P EY _ F AO R _ DH EH R _ S IY Z AH N _ T IH K AH T S .

But experience is a wonderful thing. :: B AH T _ IH K S P IH R IY AH N S _ IH Z _ AH _ W AH N D ER F AH L _ TH IH NG .
Surely it should be the other way round. :: SH UH R L IY _ IH T _ SH UH D _ B IY _ DH AH _ AH DH ER _ W EY _ R AW N D .
The building was starting to come down. :: DH AH _ B IH L D IH NG _ W AA Z _ S T AA R T IH NG _ T UW _ K AH M _ D AW N .

It was decided he should be dismissed. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ D IH S AY D IH D _ HH IY _ SH UH D _ B IY _ D IH S M IH S T .
However, that is not in itself enough. :: HH AW EH V ER , DH AE T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ IH N _ IH T S EH L F _ IH N AH F .
It could have taken another two months. :: IH T _ K UH D _ HH AE V _ T EY K AH N _ AH N AH DH ER _ T UW _ M AH N TH S .
Since then it has become a tradition. :: S IH N S _ DH EH N _ IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH K AH M _ AH _ T R AH D IH SH AH N .

What method of funding is being used? :: W AH T _ M EH TH AH D _ AH V _ F AH N D IH NG _ IH Z _ B IY IH NG _ Y UW Z D ?
They have not given them the evidence. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ G IH V AH N _ DH EH M _ DH AH _ EH V AH D AH N S .
We were not allowed to go to help them. :: W IY _ W ER _ N AA T _ AH L AW D _ T UW _ G OW _ T UW _ HH EH L P _ DH EH M .
However, there is an issue, isn't there? :: HH AW EH V ER , DH EH R _ IH Z _ AE N _ IH SH UW , IH Z AH N T _ DH EH R ?
It was a miserable afternoon in Fife. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ M IH Z ER AH B AH L _ AE F T ER N UW N _ IH N _ F AY F .
I'm so pleased the show has won a prize. :: AY M _ S OW _ P L IY Z D _ DH AH _ SH OW _ HH AE Z _ W AH N _ AH _ P R AY Z .
However, it is not as simple as this. :: HH AW EH V ER , IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AE Z _ S IH M P AH L _ AE Z _ DH IH S .
It was an easy decision to come here. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AE N _ IY Z IY _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ T UW _ K AH M _ HH IY R .
There's a sense of excess in the novel. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ S EH N S _ AH V _ EH K S EH S _ IH N _ DH AH _ N AA V AH L .
Chambers said he would accept the place. :: CH EY M B ER Z _ S EH D _ HH IY _ W UH D _ AE K S EH P T _ DH AH _ P L EY S .

The release attracted little attention. :: DH AH _ R IY L IY S _ AH T R AE K T AH D _ L IH T AH L _ AH T EH N SH AH N .
The decision is an absolute disgrace. :: DH AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ IH Z _ AE N _ AE B S AH L UW T _ D IH S G R EY S .
They were not seeking the right to strike. :: DH EY _ W ER _ N AA T _ S IY K IH NG _ DH AH _ R AY T _ T UW _ S T R AY K .
Her experience is certainly limited. :: HH ER _ IH K S P IH R IY AH N S _ IH Z _ S ER T AH N L IY _ L IH M AH T AH D .

There can be no compromise on welfare. :: DH EH R _ K AE N _ B IY _ N OW _ K AA M P R AH M AY Z _ AA N _ W EH L F EH R .
Today we must not repeat that mistake. :: T AH D EY _ W IY _ M AH S T _ N AA T _ R IH P IY T _ DH AE T _ M IH S T EY K .
They failed to reach agreement yesterday. :: DH EY _ F EY L D _ T UW _ R IY CH _ AH G R IY M AH N T _ Y EH S T ER D EY .
It is about control of our economy. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH B AW T _ K AH N T R OW L _ AH V _ AW ER _ IH K AA N AH M IY .
I was given no instructions by no-one. :: AY _ W AA Z _ G IH V AH N _ N OW _ IH N S T R AH K SH AH N Z _ B AY _ N UW N .
He was failed by his health authority. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ F EY L D _ B AY _ HH IH Z _ HH EH L TH _ AH TH AO R AH T IY .
Put simply, it goes something like this. :: P UH T _ S IH M P L IY , IH T _ G OW Z _ S AH M TH IH NG _ L AY K _ DH IH S .
We want to lift the cup for the fans. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ L IH F T _ DH AH _ K AH P _ F AO R _ DH AH _ F AE N Z .
Like many companies, it is a problem. :: L AY K _ M EH N IY _ K AH M P AH N IY Z , IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ P R AA B L AH M .
An announcement is expected this week. :: AE N _ AH N AW N S M AH N T _ IH Z _ IH K S P EH K T AH D _ DH IH S _ W IY K .
We could soon be in that same position! :: W IY _ K UH D _ S UW N _ B IY _ IH N _ DH AE T _ S EY M _ P AH Z IH SH AH N !
The whole thing is utterly transparent. :: DH AH _ HH OW L _ TH IH NG _ IH Z _ AH T ER L IY _ T R AE N S P EH R AH N T .
People were actually not on his side. :: P IY P AH L _ W ER _ AE K CH AH W AH L IY _ N AA T _ AA N _ HH IH Z _ S AY D .
The defender made an impressive debut. :: DH AH _ D IH F EH N D ER _ M EY D _ AE N _ IH M P R EH S IH V _ D EY B Y UW .
I told them during their morning break. :: AY _ T OW L D _ DH EH M _ D UH R IH NG _ DH EH R _ M AO R N IH NG _ B R EY K .
The value of the merger is still there. :: DH AH _ V AE L Y UW _ AH V _ DH AH _ M ER JH ER _ IH Z _ S T IH L _ DH EH R .
Because I was a very physical person. :: B IH K AO Z _ AY _ W AA Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ F IH Z IH K AH L _ P ER S AH N .
We showed some spirit against Newcastle. :: W IY _ SH OW D _ S AH M _ S P IH R AH T _ AH G EH N S T _ N UW K AE S AH L .
He added, We are not prepared for war. :: HH IY _ AE D AH D , W IY _ AA R _ N AA T _ P R IY P EH R D _ F AO R _ W AO R .
It had so much to do with the output. :: IH T _ HH AE D _ S OW _ M AH CH _ T UW _ D UW _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ AW T P UH T .
was everything done to save the people? :: W AA Z _ EH V R IY TH IH NG _ D AH N _ T UW _ S EY V _ DH AH _ P IY P AH L ?
We will treat it like a World Cup match. :: W IY _ W IH L _ T R IY T _ IH T _ L AY K _ AH _ W ER L D _ K AH P _ M AE CH .
You just have to give yourself a chance. :: Y UW _ JH AH S T _ HH AE V _ T UW _ G IH V _ Y ER S EH L F _ AH _ CH AE N S .
In Europe, it is always over two games. :: IH N _ Y UH R AH P , IH T _ IH Z _ AO L W EY Z _ OW V ER _ T UW _ G EY M Z .
Another reason is a shortage of stock. :: AH N AH DH ER _ R IY Z AH N _ IH Z _ AH _ SH AO R T AH JH _ AH V _ S T AA K .
Progress is being made but it is slow. :: P R AA G R EH S _ IH Z _ B IY IH NG _ M EY D _ B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ S L OW .
We didn't think anything would happen. :: W IY _ D IH D AH N T _ TH IH NG K _ EH N IY TH IH NG _ W UH D _ HH AE P AH N .
The company reacted very, very well. :: DH AH _ K AH M P AH N IY _ R IY AE K T AH D _ V EH R IY , V EH R IY _ W EH L .
He wanted someone young and ambitious. :: HH IY _ W AA N T AH D _ S AH M W AH N _ Y AH NG _ AH N D _ AE M B IH SH AH S .
It is surprising to come back this way. :: IH T _ IH Z _ S ER P R AY Z IH NG _ T UW _ K AH M _ B AE K _ DH IH S _ W EY .
Self control is just one instalment. :: S EH L F _ K AH N T R OW L _ IH Z _ JH AH S T _ W AH N _ IH N S T AO L M AH N T .
The only answer is a public inquiry. :: DH AH _ OW N L IY _ AE N S ER _ IH Z _ AH _ P AH B L IH K _ IH N K W AY R IY .
I have been here for only three months. :: AY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ HH IY R _ F AO R _ OW N L IY _ TH R IY _ M AH N TH S .
It's been quite a turnaround for Miami. :: IH T S _ B IH N _ K W AY T _ AH _ T ER N ER AW N D _ F AO R _ M AY AE M IY .
That was the context of his remarks. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ K AA N T EH K S T _ AH V _ HH IH Z _ R IH M AA R K S .
You could see he was thinking about it. :: Y UW _ K UH D _ S IY _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ TH IH NG K IH NG _ AH B AW T _ IH T .
However, it seems that he got it wrong. :: HH AW EH V ER , IH T _ S IY M Z _ DH AE T _ HH IY _ G AA T _ IH T _ R AO NG .
The result could be all down to turnout. :: DH AH _ R IH Z AH L T _ K UH D _ B IY _ AO L _ D AW N _ T UW _ T ER N AW T .
I think he was nervous to begin with. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ N ER V AH S _ T UW _ B IH G IH N _ W IH DH .
Have you heard anything from Paramount? :: HH AE V _ Y UW _ HH ER D _ EH N IY TH IH NG _ F R AH M _ P EH R AH M AW N T ?
I think they are right to be impatient. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ DH EY _ AA R _ R AY T _ T UW _ B IY _ IH M P EY SH AH N T .
The attack was totally out of the blue. :: DH AH _ AH T AE K _ W AA Z _ T OW T AH L IY _ AW T _ AH V _ DH AH _ B L UW .
There's a good chance of seeing something. :: DH EH R Z _ AH _ G UH D _ CH AE N S _ AH V _ S IY IH NG _ S AH M TH IH NG .
I decided not to renew the contract. :: AY _ D IH S AY D IH D _ N AA T _ T UW _ R IH N UW _ DH AH _ K AA N T R AE K T .
Our position is not a logic of war. :: AW ER _ P AH Z IH SH AH N _ IH Z _ N AA T _ AH _ L AA JH IH K _ AH V _ W AO R .
Everything is surrounded by confusion. :: EH V R IY TH IH NG _ IH Z _ S ER AW N D AH D _ B AY _ K AH N F Y UW ZH AH N .
It was the crowning point of my career. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ K R AW N IH NG _ P OY N T _ AH V _ M AY _ K ER IH R .
With him are the symbols of his faith. :: W IH DH _ HH IH M _ AA R _ DH AH _ S IH M B AH L Z _ AH V _ HH IH Z _ F EY TH .
Nor does it have a stock of medicines. :: N AO R _ D AH Z _ IH T _ HH AE V _ AH _ S T AA K _ AH V _ M EH D AH S AH N Z .
That gives us something to kick against. :: DH AE T _ G IH V Z _ AH S _ S AH M TH IH NG _ T UW _ K IH K _ AH G EH N S T .
Yet he chose to do something different. :: Y EH T _ HH IY _ CH OW Z _ T UW _ D UW _ S AH M TH IH NG _ D IH F ER AH N T .
After all, he is the King of Scotland. :: AE F T ER _ AO L , HH IY _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K IH NG _ AH V _ S K AA T L AH N D .
However, it very nearly all went wrong. :: HH AW EH V ER , IH T _ V EH R IY _ N IH R L IY _ AO L _ W EH N T _ R AO NG .
That was merely their initial problem. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ M IH R L IY _ DH EH R _ IH N IH SH AH L _ P R AA B L AH M .
I am not holding the club to ransom. :: AY _ AE M _ N AA T _ HH OW L D IH NG _ DH AH _ K L AH B _ T UW _ R AE N S AH M .
This meeting is the path to salvation. :: DH IH S _ M IY T IH NG _ IH Z _ DH AH _ P AE TH _ T UW _ S AE L V EY SH AH N .
Surely this is not supposed to happen? :: SH UH R L IY _ DH IH S _ IH Z _ N AA T _ S AH P OW Z D _ T UW _ HH AE P AH N ?
He did the right thing by ignoring me. :: HH IY _ D IH D _ DH AH _ R AY T _ TH IH NG _ B AY _ IH G N AO R IH NG _ M IY .
There have been a lot of lessons learned. :: DH EH R _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ L EH S AH N Z _ L ER N D .
There has been a big change in defence. :: DH EH R _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ AH _ B IH G _ CH EY N JH _ IH N _ D IH F EH N S .
Military chiefs were playing it straight. :: M IH L AH T EH R IY _ CH IY F S _ W ER _ P L EY IH NG _ IH T _ S T R EY T .
It is not really used by many people. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ R IH L IY _ Y UW Z D _ B AY _ M EH N IY _ P IY P AH L .
He confirmed there had been no warning. :: HH IY _ K AH N F ER M D _ DH EH R _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ N OW _ W AO R N IH NG .
It has changed, and not for the better. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ CH EY N JH D , AH N D _ N AA T _ F AO R _ DH AH _ B EH T ER .
But this one has a lot of potential. :: B AH T _ DH IH S _ W AH N _ HH AE Z _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ P AH T EH N SH AH L .
It was all very proper and civilised. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AO L _ V EH R IY _ P R AA P ER _ AH N D _ S IH V AH L AY Z D .
I believe he could have turned it around. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ HH IY _ K UH D _ HH AE V _ T ER N D _ IH T _ ER AW N D .
I'm confident of the outcome this week. :: AY M _ K AA N F AH D AH N T _ AH V _ DH AH _ AW T K AH M _ DH IH S _ W IY K .
That figure will always remain with me. :: DH AE T _ F IH G Y ER _ W IH L _ AO L W EY Z _ R IH M EY N _ W IH DH _ M IY .
I thought they could have made the gesture. :: AY _ TH AO T _ DH EY _ K UH D _ HH AE V _ M EY D _ DH AH _ JH EH S CH ER .
Players are fighting to stay in the team. :: P L EY ER Z _ AA R _ F AY T IH NG _ T UW _ S T EY _ IH N _ DH AH _ T IY M .
She has nothing to say to journalists. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ N AH TH IH NG _ T UW _ S EY _ T UW _ JH ER N AH L AH S T S .
Two others were also seriously injured. :: T UW _ AH DH ER Z _ W ER _ AO L S OW _ S IH R IY AH S L IY _ IH N JH ER D .
This was not a summit about the euro. :: DH IH S _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ AH _ S AH M AH T _ AH B AW T _ DH AH _ Y UW R OW .
But that night they killed her housekeeper. :: B AH T _ DH AE T _ N AY T _ DH EY _ K IH L D _ HH ER _ HH AW S K IY P ER .
I'm astonished the men were not injured. :: AY M _ AH S T AA N IH SH T _ DH AH _ M EH N _ W ER _ N AA T _ IH N JH ER D .
But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much. :: B AH T _ P ER HH AE P S _ W IY _ SH UH D AH N T _ W ER IY _ T UW _ M AH CH .
I accept that, but is very upsetting. :: AY _ AE K S EH P T _ DH AE T , B AH T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ AH P S EH T IH NG .
However, our players will fight for that. :: HH AW EH V ER , AW ER _ P L EY ER Z _ W IH L _ F AY T _ F AO R _ DH AE T .
The following year, they asked him again. :: DH AH _ F AA L OW IH NG _ Y IH R , DH EY _ AE S K T _ HH IH M _ AH G EH N .
I should have given him one in return. :: AY _ SH UH D _ HH AE V _ G IH V AH N _ HH IH M _ W AH N _ IH N _ R IH T ER N .
His art was not just about emotions. :: HH IH Z _ AA R T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ JH AH S T _ AH B AW T _ IH M OW SH AH N Z .
We were beaten by the better team today. :: W IY _ W ER _ B IY T AH N _ B AY _ DH AH _ B EH T ER _ T IY M _ T AH D EY .
I was not happy about being left out. :: AY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ HH AE P IY _ AH B AW T _ B IY IH NG _ L EH F T _ AW T .
He was not seeking special advantage. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ S IY K IH NG _ S P EH SH AH L _ AE D V AE N T IH JH .
He was different from the rest of us. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ D IH F ER AH N T _ F R AH M _ DH AH _ R EH S T _ AH V _ AH S .
Europe is a hugely contentious issue. :: Y UH R AH P _ IH Z _ AH _ HH Y UW JH L IY _ K AH N T EH N SH AH S _ IH SH UW .
I am prepared to help make it happen. :: AY _ AE M _ P R IY P EH R D _ T UW _ HH EH L P _ M EY K _ IH T _ HH AE P AH N .
Later, a very different story emerged. :: L EY T ER , AH _ V EH R IY _ D IH F ER AH N T _ S T AO R IY _ IH M ER JH D .
The warning was lifted late last night. :: DH AH _ W AO R N IH NG _ W AA Z _ L IH F T AH D _ L EY T _ L AE S T _ N AY T .
I don't think he was being very fair. :: AY _ D OW N T _ TH IH NG K _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ B IY IH NG _ V EH R IY _ F EH R .
This is wrong, but it's what is believed. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ R AO NG , B AH T _ IH T S _ W AH T _ IH Z _ B IH L IY V D .
He is very confident at the moment. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ K AA N F AH D AH N T _ AE T _ DH AH _ M OW M AH N T .
I am very excited about this season. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ IH K S AY T AH D _ AH B AW T _ DH IH S _ S IY Z AH N .
Nor was it a game without its lessons. :: N AO R _ W AA Z _ IH T _ AH _ G EY M _ W IH TH AW T _ IH T S _ L EH S AH N Z .
They received no money under the merger. :: DH EY _ R AH S IY V D _ N OW _ M AH N IY _ AH N D ER _ DH AH _ M ER JH ER .
It means the margin for error is tight. :: IH T _ M IY N Z _ DH AH _ M AA R JH AH N _ F AO R _ EH R ER _ IH Z _ T AY T .
It was his greatest movie performance. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ HH IH Z _ G R EY T AH S T _ M UW V IY _ P ER F AO R M AH N S .
The potential is always in the idea. :: DH AH _ P AH T EH N SH AH L _ IH Z _ AO L W EY Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ AY D IY AH .
Whatever we do, we know we can do well. :: W AH T EH V ER _ W IY _ D UW , W IY _ N OW _ W IY _ K AE N _ D UW _ W EH L .
I believe it would have been successful. :: AY _ B IH L IY V _ IH T _ W UH D _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ S AH K S EH S F AH L .
As for the warning, it was not needed. :: AE Z _ F AO R _ DH AH _ W AO R N IH NG , IH T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ N IY D AH D .
They were not at the property yesterday. :: DH EY _ W ER _ N AA T _ AE T _ DH AH _ P R AA P ER T IY _ Y EH S T ER D EY .
And it had been a marvellous occasion. :: AH N D _ IH T _ HH AE D _ B IH N _ AH _ M AA R V AH L AH S _ AH K EY ZH AH N .
He seems to be pleased with the picture. :: HH IY _ S IY M Z _ T UW _ B IY _ P L IY Z D _ W IH DH _ DH AH _ P IH K CH ER .
She hopes to study in Britain one day. :: SH IY _ HH OW P S _ T UW _ S T AH D IY _ IH N _ B R IH T AH N _ W AH N _ D EY .
I am very interested in the subject. :: AY _ AE M _ V EH R IY _ IH N T R AH S T AH D _ IH N _ DH AH _ S AH B JH EH K T .

We want to see the maximum of change. :: W IY _ W AA N T _ T UW _ S IY _ DH AH _ M AE K S AH M AH M _ AH V _ CH EY N JH .
It is like a river running by my home. :: IH T _ IH Z _ L AY K _ AH _ R IH V ER _ R AH N IH NG _ B AY _ M AY _ HH OW M .
Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money. :: AH DH ER W AY Z , IH T _ W IH L _ K AA S T _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ M AH N IY .
This is the culture change in medicine. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ DH AH _ K AH L CH ER _ CH EY N JH _ IH N _ M EH D AH S AH N .
It may be that lifestyle is behind it. :: IH T _ M EY _ B IY _ DH AE T _ L AY F S T AY L _ IH Z _ B IH HH AY N D _ IH T .
Last night, he pledged to clear his name. :: L AE S T _ N AY T , HH IY _ P L EH JH D _ T UW _ K L IH R _ HH IH Z _ N EY M .
It only increased the support for him. :: IH T _ OW N L IY _ IH N K R IY S T _ DH AH _ S AH P AO R T _ F AO R _ HH IH M .
It was important to win the singles. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ IH M P AO R T AH N T _ T UW _ W IH N _ DH AH _ S IH NG G AH L Z .
It was all in a short period of time. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AO L _ IH N _ AH _ SH AO R T _ P IH R IY AH D _ AH V _ T AY M .
In addition, investor choice is reduced. :: IH N _ AH D IH SH AH N , IH N V EH S T ER _ CH OY S _ IH Z _ R AH D UW S T .
A Scotsman has to defend his castle. :: AH _ S K AA T S M AH N _ HH AE Z _ T UW _ D IH F EH N D _ HH IH Z _ K AE S AH L .

I have worked as a stand-up there often. :: AY _ HH AE V _ W ER K T _ AE Z _ AH _ S T AE N D AH P _ DH EH R _ AO F AH N .
Andy was a huge influence yet again. :: AE N D IY _ W AA Z _ AH _ HH Y UW JH _ IH N F L UW AH N S _ Y EH T _ AH G EH N .
Some young girls also came by last night. :: S AH M _ Y AH NG _ G ER L Z _ AO L S OW _ K EY M _ B AY _ L AE S T _ N AY T .
They have no real friends in the region. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ N OW _ R IY L _ F R EH N D Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ R IY JH AH N .
There was only one living room, you see. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ OW N L IY _ W AH N _ L IH V IH NG _ R UW M , Y UW _ S IY .
He could understand both points of view. :: HH IY _ K UH D _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ B OW TH _ P OY N T S _ AH V _ V Y UW .
His style was direct and very human. :: HH IH Z _ S T AY L _ W AA Z _ D ER EH K T _ AH N D _ V EH R IY _ HH Y UW M AH N .

This advice was accepted by ministers. :: DH IH S _ AE D V AY S _ W AA Z _ AE K S EH P T IH D _ B AY _ M IH N AH S T ER Z .
I feel very sad and extremely cut up. :: AY _ F IY L _ V EH R IY _ S AE D _ AH N D _ IH K S T R IY M L IY _ K AH T _ AH P .
ALL IS busy but not much is happening. :: AO L _ IH Z _ B IH Z IY _ B AH T _ N AA T _ M AH CH _ IH Z _ HH AE P AH N IH NG .
We understand the changes in the world. :: W IY _ AH N D ER S T AE N D _ DH AH _ CH EY N JH AH Z _ IH N _ DH AH _ W ER L D .
That is why this action has been taken. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ W AY _ DH IH S _ AE K SH AH N _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ T EY K AH N .
Players were held in equally low regard. :: P L EY ER Z _ W ER _ HH EH L D _ IH N _ IY K W AH L IY _ L OW _ R AH G AA R D .
But someone forgot to tell the Chechens. :: B AH T _ S AH M W AH N _ F ER G AA T _ T UW _ T EH L _ DH AH _ CH EH CH IH N Z .
Scotland need to work on two key areas. :: S K AA T L AH N D _ N IY D _ T UW _ W ER K _ AA N _ T UW _ K IY _ EH R IY AH Z .
We have already begun to do that here. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AO L R EH D IY _ B IH G AH N _ T UW _ D UW _ DH AE T _ HH IY R .
Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game. :: S AH D AH N L IY _ IH T _ W AA Z , IH N D IY D , AH _ N UW _ B AO L _ G EY M .
My only ambition is to enjoy my work. :: M AY _ OW N L IY _ AE M B IH SH AH N _ IH Z _ T UW _ EH N JH OY _ M AY _ W ER K .
Then one night only three people turn up. :: DH EH N _ W AH N _ N AY T _ OW N L IY _ TH R IY _ P IY P AH L _ T ER N _ AH P .
She had every right to read the warrant. :: SH IY _ HH AE D _ EH V ER IY _ R AY T _ T UW _ R EH D _ DH AH _ W AO R AH N T .
No, is the answer to your first question. :: N OW , IH Z _ DH AH _ AE N S ER _ T UW _ Y AO R _ F ER S T _ K W EH S CH AH N .
Clearly, this was the important nursing. :: K L IH R L IY , DH IH S _ W AA Z _ DH AH _ IH M P AO R T AH N T _ N ER S IH NG .
But both were involved with other matters. :: B AH T _ B OW TH _ W ER _ IH N V AA L V D _ W IH DH _ AH DH ER _ M AE T ER Z .
And they all had these other commitments. :: AH N D _ DH EY _ AO L _ HH AE D _ DH IY Z _ AH DH ER _ K AH M IH T M AH N T S .
Did he always want to be a comedian? :: D IH D _ HH IY _ AO L W EY Z _ W AA N T _ T UW _ B IY _ AH _ K AH M IY D IY AH N ?
She has insisted she did nothing wrong. :: SH IY _ HH AE Z _ IH N S IH S T AH D _ SH IY _ D IH D _ N AH TH IH NG _ R AO NG .
He said he was delighted by the award. :: HH IY _ S EH D _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ D IH L AY T AH D _ B AY _ DH AH _ AH W AO R D .
I can't believe we didn't win that game. :: AY _ K AE N T _ B IH L IY V _ W IY _ D IH D AH N T _ W IH N _ DH AE T _ G EY M .
In fact, it might just be the beginning. :: IH N _ F AE K T , IH T _ M AY T _ JH AH S T _ B IY _ DH AH _ B IH G IH N IH NG .
Its effect on humans is not yet known. :: IH T S _ IH F EH K T _ AA N _ HH Y UW M AH N Z _ IH Z _ N AA T _ Y EH T _ N OW N .
They've just got to believe in themselves. :: DH EY V _ JH AH S T _ G AA T _ T UW _ B IH L IY V _ IH N _ DH EH M S EH L V Z .
We haven't found out anything different. :: W IY _ HH AE V AH N T _ F AW N D _ AW T _ EH N IY TH IH NG _ D IH F ER AH N T .
Still, in the end, it was a fair result. :: S T IH L , IH N _ DH AH _ EH N D , IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ F EH R _ R IH Z AH L T .
I didn't want to fall out with anyone. :: AY _ D IH D AH N T _ W AA N T _ T UW _ F AO L _ AW T _ W IH DH _ EH N IY W AH N .
The next eight weeks are critical to us. :: DH AH _ N EH K S T _ EY T _ W IY K S _ AA R _ K R IH T IH K AH L _ T UW _ AH S .
Instead, it is back to the drawing board. :: IH N S T EH D , IH T _ IH Z _ B AE K _ T UW _ DH AH _ D R AO IH NG _ B AO R D .
We are obviously disturbed by this case. :: W IY _ AA R _ AA B V IY AH S L IY _ D IH S T ER B D _ B AY _ DH IH S _ K EY S .
I don't believe that money is the answer. :: AY _ D OW N T _ B IH L IY V _ DH AE T _ M AH N IY _ IH Z _ DH AH _ AE N S ER .
There are no problems between us at all. :: DH EH R _ AA R _ N OW _ P R AA B L AH M Z _ B IH T W IY N _ AH S _ AE T _ AO L .
However, we let them back into the game. :: HH AW EH V ER , W IY _ L EH T _ DH EH M _ B AE K _ IH N T UW _ DH AH _ G EY M .
These services may also have to be cut. :: DH IY Z _ S ER V AH S AH Z _ M EY _ AO L S OW _ HH AE V _ T UW _ B IY _ K AH T .
We talk to each other about these matters. :: W IY _ T AO K _ T UW _ IY CH _ AH DH ER _ AH B AW T _ DH IY Z _ M AE T ER Z .
I am still pretty young in this business. :: AY _ AE M _ S T IH L _ P R IH T IY _ Y AH NG _ IH N _ DH IH S _ B IH Z N AH S .
Their welfare is very important to us. :: DH EH R _ W EH L F EH R _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ IH M P AO R T AH N T _ T UW _ AH S .
O Leary now intends to take a holiday. :: OW _ L IH R IY _ N AW _ IH N T EH N D Z _ T UW _ T EY K _ AH _ HH AA L AH D EY .
This is a very special moment for me. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ V EH R IY _ S P EH SH AH L _ M OW M AH N T _ F AO R _ M IY .
I want somebody with something to prove. :: AY _ W AA N T _ S AH M B AA D IY _ W IH DH _ S AH M TH IH NG _ T UW _ P R UW V .
I don't think the action was a mistake. :: AY _ D OW N T _ TH IH NG K _ DH AH _ AE K SH AH N _ W AA Z _ AH _ M IH S T EY K .
Detectives are still working on the case. :: D IH T EH K T IH V Z _ AA R _ S T IH L _ W ER K IH NG _ AA N _ DH AH _ K EY S .
It was love of Helen and the children. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ L AH V _ AH V _ HH EH L AH N _ AH N D _ DH AH _ CH IH L D R AH N .
It comes down to the police in England. :: IH T _ K AH M Z _ D AW N _ T UW _ DH AH _ P AH L IY S _ IH N _ IH NG G L AH N D .
British officials said they could not say. :: B R IH T IH SH _ AH F IH SH AH L Z _ S EH D _ DH EY _ K UH D _ N AA T _ S EY .
Was he confident about his prospects? :: W AA Z _ HH IY _ K AA N F AH D AH N T _ AH B AW T _ HH IH Z _ P R AA S P EH K T S ?
When you think you cannot go on, you can. :: W EH N _ Y UW _ TH IH NG K _ Y UW _ K AE N AA T _ G OW _ AA N , Y UW _ K AE N .
That can benefit the larger companies. :: DH AE T _ K AE N _ B EH N AH F IH T _ DH AH _ L AA R JH ER _ K AH M P AH N IY Z .
However, the story has a happy ending. :: HH AW EH V ER , DH AH _ S T AO R IY _ HH AE Z _ AH _ HH AE P IY _ EH N D IH NG .
I only found out about it this morning. :: AY _ OW N L IY _ F AW N D _ AW T _ AH B AW T _ IH T _ DH IH S _ M AO R N IH NG .
We have been overwhelmed by the response. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ OW V ER W EH L M D _ B AY _ DH AH _ R IH S P AA N S .
I'd love the chance to play for Scotland. :: AY D _ L AH V _ DH AH _ CH AE N S _ T UW _ P L EY _ F AO R _ S K AA T L AH N D .
PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines. :: P EH N SH AH N Z _ HH AE V _ B IH N _ HH IH T IH NG _ DH AH _ HH EH D L AY N Z .
New investment will be openly tendered. :: N UW _ IH N V EH S T M AH N T _ W IH L _ B IY _ OW P AH N L IY _ T EH N D ER D .
Despite that, it was a great day for me. :: D IH S P AY T _ DH AE T , IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ G R EY T _ D EY _ F AO R _ M IY .
His condition was serious but stable. :: HH IH Z _ K AH N D IH SH AH N _ W AA Z _ S IH R IY AH S _ B AH T _ S T EY B AH L .
I was very pleased with them today, though. :: AY _ W AA Z _ V EH R IY _ P L IY Z D _ W IH DH _ DH EH M _ T AH D EY , DH OW .
However, we had no failures in our side. :: HH AW EH V ER , W IY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ F EY L Y ER Z _ IH N _ AW ER _ S AY D .
Stewart will travel with some confidence. :: S T UW ER T _ W IH L _ T R AE V AH L _ W IH DH _ S AH M _ K AA N F AH D AH N S .
No production contract is yet in sight. :: N OW _ P R AH D AH K SH AH N _ K AA N T R AE K T _ IH Z _ Y EH T _ IH N _ S AY T .
This is a trend which will be encouraged. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ T R EH N D _ W IH CH _ W IH L _ B IY _ EH N K ER IH JH D .
We represent a wide range of society. :: W IY _ R EH P R AH Z EH N T _ AH _ W AY D _ R EY N JH _ AH V _ S AH S AY AH T IY .
Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape. :: N AW , S AH D AH N L IY , W IY _ HH AE V _ DH IH S _ N UW _ L AE N D S K EY P .
That is a trend which will be encouraged. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ AH _ T R EH N D _ W IH CH _ W IH L _ B IY _ EH N K ER IH JH D .
You have no chance of planning permission. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ N OW _ CH AE N S _ AH V _ P L AE N IH NG _ P ER M IH SH AH N .
You must always attempt to raise the bar. :: Y UW _ M AH S T _ AO L W EY Z _ AH T EH M P T _ T UW _ R EY Z _ DH AH _ B AA R .
But they have taken the lesson to heart. :: B AH T _ DH EY _ HH AE V _ T EY K AH N _ DH AH _ L EH S AH N _ T UW _ HH AA R T .
We welcome the decision of Mr Byers. :: W IY _ W EH L K AH M _ DH AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N _ AH V _ M IH S T ER _ B AY ER Z .
There is no point in looking any further. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ P OY N T _ IH N _ L UH K IH NG _ EH N IY _ F ER DH ER .
It is ambitious, but it can be achieved. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AE M B IH SH AH S , B AH T _ IH T _ K AE N _ B IY _ AH CH IY V D .
This is a major property in Edinburgh. :: DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ M EY JH ER _ P R AA P ER T IY _ IH N _ EH D AH N B ER OW .

No plans for projects are yet in place. :: N OW _ P L AE N Z _ F AO R _ P R AA JH EH K T S _ AA R _ Y EH T _ IH N _ P L EY S .

The breakdown was much later in her life. :: DH AH _ B R EY K D AW N _ W AA Z _ M AH CH _ L EY T ER _ IH N _ HH ER _ L AY F .
That was not perfect golf by any means. :: DH AE T _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ P ER F EH K T _ G AA L F _ B AY _ EH N IY _ M IY N Z .
Sales will begin by the end of October. :: S EY L Z _ W IH L _ B IH G IH N _ B AY _ DH AH _ EH N D _ AH V _ AA K T OW B ER .
Other villages were completely deserted. :: AH DH ER _ V IH L AH JH AH Z _ W ER _ K AH M P L IY T L IY _ D IH Z ER T IH D .
His second goal was equally impressive. :: HH IH Z _ S EH K AH N D _ G OW L _ W AA Z _ IY K W AH L IY _ IH M P R EH S IH V .
Britain is going to celebrate in style. :: B R IH T AH N _ IH Z _ G OW IH NG _ T UW _ S EH L AH B R EY T _ IH N _ S T AY L .
He can handle it without any problem. :: HH IY _ K AE N _ HH AE N D AH L _ IH T _ W IH TH AW T _ EH N IY _ P R AA B L AH M .
What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick? :: W AH T _ K AY N D _ AH V _ AH _ M AE N _ D AH Z _ DH AE T , M IH S T ER _ D IH K ?
Today, we begin to answer that question. :: T AH D EY , W IY _ B IH G IH N _ T UW _ AE N S ER _ DH AE T _ K W EH S CH AH N .
I haven't made any definite decisions. :: AY _ HH AE V AH N T _ M EY D _ EH N IY _ D EH F AH N AH T _ D IH S IH ZH AH N Z .
The group is separate from the Real IRA. :: DH AH _ G R UW P _ IH Z _ S EH P ER EY T _ F R AH M _ DH AH _ R IY L _ AY R AH .
There is no mandate for a regime change. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ M AE N D EY T _ F AO R _ AH _ R AH ZH IY M _ CH EY N JH .
The company was set up six years ago. :: DH AH _ K AH M P AH N IY _ W AA Z _ S EH T _ AH P _ S IH K S _ Y IH R Z _ AH G OW .
We have to find a way to put that right. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ T UW _ F AY N D _ AH _ W EY _ T UW _ P UH T _ DH AE T _ R AY T .
There should be room for creative dissent. :: DH EH R _ SH UH D _ B IY _ R UW M _ F AO R _ K R IY EY T IH V _ D IH S EH N T .
It also opened a branch in Livingston. :: IH T _ AO L S OW _ OW P AH N D _ AH _ B R AE N CH _ IH N _ L IH V IH NG S T AH N .
He was said to be emotionally disturbed. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ S EH D _ T UW _ B IY _ IH M OW SH N AH L IY _ D IH S T ER B D .
The money needs to go to the front line. :: DH AH _ M AH N IY _ N IY D Z _ T UW _ G OW _ T UW _ DH AH _ F R AH N T _ L AY N .
I was not involved in these discussions. :: AY _ W AA Z _ N AA T _ IH N V AA L V D _ IH N _ DH IY Z _ D IH S K AH SH AH N Z .
She does not see anything ever changing. :: SH IY _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ S IY _ EH N IY TH IH NG _ EH V ER _ CH EY N JH IH NG .
It should not make the same mistake again. :: IH T _ SH UH D _ N AA T _ M EY K _ DH AH _ S EY M _ M IH S T EY K _ AH G EH N .
The balance is all wrong in this country. :: DH AH _ B AE L AH N S _ IH Z _ AO L _ R AO NG _ IH N _ DH IH S _ K AH N T R IY .
So he was anxious to try something new. :: S OW _ HH IY _ W AA Z _ AE NG K SH AH S _ T UW _ T R AY _ S AH M TH IH NG _ N UW .
But he is something special, is he not? :: B AH T _ HH IY _ IH Z _ S AH M TH IH NG _ S P EH SH AH L , IH Z _ HH IY _ N AA T ?
The attitude and commitment was decent. :: DH AH _ AE T AH T UW D _ AH N D _ K AH M IH T M AH N T _ W AA Z _ D IY S AH N T .
This must be kept in total perspective. :: DH IH S _ M AH S T _ B IY _ K EH P T _ IH N _ T OW T AH L _ P ER S P EH K T IH V .
She's the runner - she makes the decisions. :: SH IY Z _ DH AH _ R AH N ER - SH IY _ M EY K S _ DH AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N Z .
We should not bring him into a dispute. :: W IY _ SH UH D _ N AA T _ B R IH NG _ HH IH M _ IH N T UW _ AH _ D IH S P Y UW T .
And he listens to his artists as well. :: AH N D _ HH IY _ L IH S AH N Z _ T UW _ HH IH Z _ AA R T AH S T S _ AE Z _ W EH L .
I'm not thinking too much about the tour. :: AY M _ N AA T _ TH IH NG K IH NG _ T UW _ M AH CH _ AH B AW T _ DH AH _ T UH R .
In my experience, he does not do that. :: IH N _ M AY _ IH K S P IH R IY AH N S , HH IY _ D AH Z _ N AA T _ D UW _ DH AE T .
I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office. :: AY _ EH N JH OY D _ M AY _ W ER K _ IH N _ DH AH _ S K AA T IH SH _ AO F AH S .
Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages. :: M AY N D _ Y UW , HH IY _ HH AE Z AH N T _ B IH N _ B AE K _ F AO R _ EY JH AH Z .
The supporters gave us a lot of passion. :: DH AH _ S AH P AO R T ER Z _ G EY V _ AH S _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ P AE SH AH N .
His parenthood is called into question. :: HH IH Z _ P EH R AH N T HH UH D _ IH Z _ K AO L D _ IH N T UW _ K W EH S CH AH N .
We have our supporters and our enemies. :: W IY _ HH AE V _ AW ER _ S AH P AO R T ER Z _ AH N D _ AW ER _ EH N AH M IY Z .
They have a very good method of working. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ AH _ V EH R IY _ G UH D _ M EH TH AH D _ AH V _ W ER K IH NG .
It was a long process, but we got there. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ AH _ L AO NG _ P R AA S EH S , B AH T _ W IY _ G AA T _ DH EH R .
There were so many characters among them. :: DH EH R _ W ER _ S OW _ M EH N IY _ K AE R IH K T ER Z _ AH M AH NG _ DH EH M .
From then on, Scott has never looked back. :: F R AH M _ DH EH N _ AA N , S K AA T _ HH AE Z _ N EH V ER _ L UH K T _ B AE K .
They failed in their duty to Mr Logan. :: DH EY _ F EY L D _ IH N _ DH EH R _ D UW T IY _ T UW _ M IH S T ER _ L OW G AH N .
An aide was constructed to get a copy. :: AE N _ EY D _ W AA Z _ K AH N S T R AH K T AH D _ T UW _ G EH T _ AH _ K AA P IY .
Part of Johnny was found some days after. :: P AA R T _ AH V _ JH AA N IY _ W AA Z _ F AW N D _ S AH M _ D EY Z _ AE F T ER .
Does it work, is it safe, and is it right? :: D AH Z _ IH T _ W ER K , IH Z _ IH T _ S EY F , AH N D _ IH Z _ IH T _ R AY T ?
English is the language of pop music. :: IH NG G L IH SH _ IH Z _ DH AH _ L AE NG G W AH JH _ AH V _ P AA P _ M Y UW Z IH K .
Why does she suddenly win everything now? :: W AY _ D AH Z _ SH IY _ S AH D AH N L IY _ W IH N _ EH V R IY TH IH NG _ N AW ?
Scotland has been caught in the crossfire. :: S K AA T L AH N D _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ K AA T _ IH N _ DH AH _ K R AO S F AY R .
It has been blown out of all proportion. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ B L OW N _ AW T _ AH V _ AO L _ P R AH P AO R SH AH N .
I started on a fire a couple of times. :: AY _ S T AA R T AH D _ AA N _ AH _ F AY ER _ AH _ K AH P AH L _ AH V _ T AY M Z .
Some examples are presented in detail. :: S AH M _ IH G Z AE M P AH L Z _ AA R _ P R IY Z EH N T AH D _ IH N _ D IH T EY L .
People ask about the concept of a team. :: P IY P AH L _ AE S K _ AH B AW T _ DH AH _ K AA N S EH P T _ AH V _ AH _ T IY M .
He also admitted possessing a firearm. :: HH IY _ AO L S OW _ AH D M IH T AH D _ P AH Z EH S IH NG _ AH _ F AY ER AA R M .
They have not let anyone into the loop. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ N AA T _ L EH T _ EH N IY W AH N _ IH N T UW _ DH AH _ L UW P .
The starting point is pretty unusual. :: DH AH _ S T AA R T IH NG _ P OY N T _ IH Z _ P R IH T IY _ AH N Y UW ZH AH W AH L .
We don't do this for everyone, of course. :: W IY _ D OW N T _ D UW _ DH IH S _ F AO R _ EH V R IY W AH N , AH V _ K AO R S .
The performance was really, really immense. :: DH AH _ P ER F AO R M AH N S _ W AA Z _ R IH L IY , R IH L IY _ IH M EH N S .
His arrival could be the making of them. :: HH IH Z _ ER AY V AH L _ K UH D _ B IY _ DH AH _ M EY K IH NG _ AH V _ DH EH M .
It's not the end of the matter, of course. :: IH T S _ N AA T _ DH AH _ EH N D _ AH V _ DH AH _ M AE T ER , AH V _ K AO R S .
Attack appears to be the biggest concern. :: AH T AE K _ AH P IH R Z _ T UW _ B IY _ DH AH _ B IH G AH S T _ K AH N S ER N .
Glasgow, however, did not get a mention. :: G L AE S K OW , HH AW EH V ER , D IH D _ N AA T _ G EH T _ AH _ M EH N SH AH N .
When it comes down to it, this is a job. :: W EH N _ IH T _ K AH M Z _ D AW N _ T UW _ IH T , DH IH S _ IH Z _ AH _ JH AA B .
However, we had no failures on our side. :: HH AW EH V ER , W IY _ HH AE D _ N OW _ F EY L Y ER Z _ AA N _ AW ER _ S AY D .

We are making progress on waiting lists. :: W IY _ AA R _ M EY K IH NG _ P R AA G R EH S _ AA N _ W EY T IH NG _ L IH S T S .
But is this enough to provoke a killing? :: B AH T _ IH Z _ DH IH S _ IH N AH F _ T UW _ P R AH V OW K _ AH _ K IH L IH NG ?
I just hope it's not tonight against us. :: AY _ JH AH S T _ HH OW P _ IH T S _ N AA T _ T AH N AY T _ AH G EH N S T _ AH S .
You have obviously got an answer to it. :: Y UW _ HH AE V _ AA B V IY AH S L IY _ G AA T _ AE N _ AE N S ER _ T UW _ IH T .
He could look after himself, but didn't. :: HH IY _ K UH D _ L UH K _ AE F T ER _ HH IH M S EH L F , B AH T _ D IH D AH N T .
That is different from being impartial. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ D IH F ER AH N T _ F R AH M _ B IY IH NG _ IH M P AA R SH AH L .
It is a weakness, and not the only one. :: IH T _ IH Z _ AH _ W IY K N AH S , AH N D _ N AA T _ DH AH _ OW N L IY _ W AH N .
Times have changed, but have they improved? :: T AY M Z _ HH AE V _ CH EY N JH D , B AH T _ HH AE V _ DH EY _ IH M P R UW V D ?
I'm interested in all kinds of history. :: AY M _ IH N T R AH S T AH D _ IH N _ AO L _ K AY N D Z _ AH V _ HH IH S T ER IY .
Today is the first step in that process. :: T AH D EY _ IH Z _ DH AH _ F ER S T _ S T EH P _ IH N _ DH AE T _ P R AA S EH S .
The search is due to be completed today. :: DH AH _ S ER CH _ IH Z _ D UW _ T UW _ B IY _ K AH M P L IY T AH D _ T AH D EY .
I would like to make an impact, of course. :: AY _ W UH D _ L AY K _ T UW _ M EY K _ AE N _ IH M P AE K T , AH V _ K AO R S .
I have never been in anything like that. :: AY _ HH AE V _ N EH V ER _ B IH N _ IH N _ EH N IY TH IH NG _ L AY K _ DH AE T .
I'm sorry if any offence has been caused. :: AY M _ S AA R IY _ IH F _ EH N IY _ AH F EH N S _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ K AA Z D .
But we wouldn't want them any other way. :: B AH T _ W IY _ W UH D AH N T _ W AA N T _ DH EH M _ EH N IY _ AH DH ER _ W EY .
Footage has been passed on to the police. :: F UH T IH JH _ HH AE Z _ B IH N _ P AE S T _ AA N _ T UW _ DH AH _ P AH L IY S .
That has proved to be a lasting lesson. :: DH AE T _ HH AE Z _ P R UW V D _ T UW _ B IY _ AH _ L AE S T IH NG _ L EH S AH N .
The service will only survive with change. :: DH AH _ S ER V AH S _ W IH L _ OW N L IY _ S ER V AY V _ W IH DH _ CH EY N JH .
There is no point of looking any further. :: DH EH R _ IH Z _ N OW _ P OY N T _ AH V _ L UH K IH NG _ EH N IY _ F ER DH ER .
Surely they were on a hiding to nothing. :: SH UH R L IY _ DH EY _ W ER _ AA N _ AH _ HH AY D IH NG _ T UW _ N AH TH IH NG .
They've got a sort of unwritten contract. :: DH EY V _ G AA T _ AH _ S AO R T _ AH V _ AH N R IH T AH N _ K AA N T R AE K T .
Last night he became one of the hunted. :: L AE S T _ N AY T _ HH IY _ B IH K EY M _ W AH N _ AH V _ DH AH _ HH AH N T AH D .
We are just happy that hasn't happened. :: W IY _ AA R _ JH AH S T _ HH AE P IY _ DH AE T _ HH AE Z AH N T _ HH AE P AH N D .
There was no-one of the required standard. :: DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N UW N _ AH V _ DH AH _ R IY K W AY ER D _ S T AE N D ER D .
He was found again almost a year later. :: HH IY _ W AA Z _ F AW N D _ AH G EH N _ AO L M OW S T _ AH _ Y IH R _ L EY T ER .
He tells the truth and that's important. :: HH IY _ T EH L Z _ DH AH _ T R UW TH _ AH N D _ DH AE T S _ IH M P AO R T AH N T .
There they were, making excuses for him. :: DH EH R _ DH EY _ W ER , M EY K IH NG _ IH K S K Y UW S IH Z _ F AO R _ HH IH M .

The problem is not confined to Glasgow. :: DH AH _ P R AA B L AH M _ IH Z _ N AA T _ K AH N F AY N D _ T UW _ G L AE S K OW .
That is how the Farmer is feeling today. :: DH AE T _ IH Z _ HH AW _ DH AH _ F AA R M ER _ IH Z _ F IY L IH NG _ T AH D EY .
And that's the trouble with this business. :: AH N D _ DH AE T S _ DH AH _ T R AH B AH L _ W IH DH _ DH IH S _ B IH Z N AH S .

There may be some evidence to this effect. :: DH EH R _ M EY _ B IY _ S AH M _ EH V AH D AH N S _ T UW _ DH IH S _ IH F EH K T .
It has the Bank of Scotland behind it. :: IH T _ HH AE Z _ DH AH _ B AE NG K _ AH V _ S K AA T L AH N D _ B IH HH AY N D _ IH T .

The prime minister will make the decision. :: DH AH _ P R AY M _ M IH N AH S T ER _ W IH L _ M EY K _ DH AH _ D IH S IH ZH AH N .
It being the weekend, there was no-one there. :: IH T _ B IY IH NG _ DH AH _ W IY K EH N D , DH EH R _ W AA Z _ N UW N _ DH EH R .
That would be the constructive way forward. :: DH AE T _ W UH D _ B IY _ DH AH _ K AH N S T R AH K T IH V _ W EY _ F AO R W ER D .
It is not the fault of one man, of course. :: IH T _ IH Z _ N AA T _ DH AH _ F AO L T _ AH V _ W AH N _ M AE N , AH V _ K AO R S .

This action reflects a slump in bookings. :: DH IH S _ AE K SH AH N _ R IH F L EH K T S _ AH _ S L AH M P _ IH N _ B UH K IH NG Z .
That group reported just before Christmas. :: DH AE T _ G R UW P _ R IY P AO R T AH D _ JH AH S T _ B IH F AO R _ K R IH S M AH S .

In that case, the children were not missing. :: IH N _ DH AE T _ K EY S , DH AH _ CH IH L D R AH N _ W ER _ N AA T _ M IH S IH NG .
He put some colour into Scottish history. :: HH IY _ P UH T _ S AH M _ K AH L ER _ IH N T UW _ S K AA T IH SH _ HH IH S T ER IY .
A recording contract is on the horizon. :: AH _ R AH K AO R D IH NG _ K AA N T R AE K T _ IH Z _ AA N _ DH AH _ HH ER AY Z AH N .

The company did not declare a dividend. :: DH AH _ K AH M P AH N IY _ D IH D _ N AA T _ D IH K L EH R _ AH _ D IH V IH D EH N D .
Being captain of this club is fantastic. :: B IY IH NG _ K AE P T AH N _ AH V _ DH IH S _ K L AH B _ IH Z _ F AE N T AE S T IH K .
Their eyes, however, told a different story. :: DH EH R _ AY Z , HH AW EH V ER , T OW L D _ AH _ D IH F ER AH N T _ S T AO R IY .
It's an option, but I can't really comment. :: IH T S _ AE N _ AA P SH AH N , B AH T _ AY _ K AE N T _ R IH L IY _ K AA M EH N T .
They have put in a lot of time and effort. :: DH EY _ HH AE V _ P UH T _ IH N _ AH _ L AA T _ AH V _ T AY M _ AH N D _ EH F ER T .
Legal opinion is that I may have a case. :: L IY G AH L _ AH P IH N Y AH N _ IH Z _ DH AE T _ AY _ M EY _ HH AE V _ AH _ K EY S .

The target is to break even by Christmas. :: DH AH _ T AA R G AH T _ IH Z _ T UW _ B R EY K _ IY V IH N _ B AY _ K R IH S M AH S .
The role of the law lords would be retained. :: DH AH _ R OW L _ AH V _ DH AH _ L AO _ L AO R D Z _ W UH D _ B IY _ R IH T EY N D .
It sounded as if it might well be tragic. :: IH T _ S AW N D AH D _ AE Z _ IH F _ IH T _ M AY T _ W EH L _ B IY _ T R AE JH IH K .
It was horrible, that musical apartheid. :: IH T _ W AA Z _ HH AO R AH B AH L , DH AE T _ M Y UW Z IH K AH L _ AH P AA R T AY T .

He is willing to pay the required amount. :: HH IY _ IH Z _ W IH L IH NG _ T UW _ P EY _ DH AH _ R IY K W AY ER D _ AH M AW N T .
One Minister said the reports were bizarre. :: W AH N _ M IH N AH S T ER _ S EH D _ DH AH _ R IH P AO R T S _ W ER _ B AH Z AA R .

Which brings us to the Scottish connection. :: W IH CH _ B R IH NG Z _ AH S _ T UW _ DH AH _ S K AA T IH SH _ K AH N EH K SH AH N .
I think we will join the single currency. :: AY _ TH IH NG K _ W IY _ W IH L _ JH OY N _ DH AH _ S IH NG G AH L _ K ER AH N S IY .
It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny. :: IH T _ W AA Z AH N T _ S OW _ P AH TH EH T IH K , IH T _ W UH D _ B IY _ F AH N IY .

They're completely different from each other. :: DH EH R _ K AH M P L IY T L IY _ D IH F ER AH N T _ F R AH M _ IY CH _ AH DH ER .

This year the exercise is being repeated. :: DH IH S _ Y IH R _ DH AH _ EH K S ER S AY Z _ IH Z _ B IY IH NG _ R IH P IY T IH D .
On the face of it, this is excellent news. :: AA N _ DH AH _ F EY S _ AH V _ IH T , DH IH S _ IH Z _ EH K S AH L AH N T _ N UW Z .
I accept that, but it is very upsetting. :: AY _ AE K S EH P T _ DH AE T , B AH T _ IH T _ IH Z _ V EH R IY _ AH P S EH T IH NG .
